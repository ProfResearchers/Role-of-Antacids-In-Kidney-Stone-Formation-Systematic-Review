# 🧪 Role of Antacids in Kidney Stone Formation: A Systematic Review  

> *A registered PROSPERO systematic review exploring the association between antacid use and kidney stone formation in humans.*  

---

## 🧭 Overview  

This project systematically investigates the potential link between **antacid exposure** (e.g., calcium carbonate, magnesium hydroxide, aluminum hydroxide, sodium bicarbonate) and the **development of kidney stones**.  

Our goal is to synthesize evidence from both clinical and mechanistic studies to clarify whether antacids influence **stone incidence, type, or biochemical pathways** related to urolithiasis.
