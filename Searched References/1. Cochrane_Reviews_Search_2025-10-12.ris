AB  -  Abstract - Background Nephrolithiasis, or urinary stone disease, in children causes significant morbidity, and is increasing in prevalence in the North American population. Therefore, medical and dietary interventions (MDI) for recurrent urinary stones in children are poised to gain increasing importance in the clinical armamentarium. Objectives To assess the effects of medical and dietary interventions (MDI) for the prevention of idiopathic urinary stones in children aged from one to 18 years. Search methods We searched multiple databases using search terms relevant to this review, including studies identified from the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, 2017, Issue 1), MEDLINE OvidSP (1946 to 14 February 2017), Embase OvidSP (1980 to 14 February 2017), International Clinical Trials Register (ICTRP) Search Portal and ClinicalTrials.gov. Additionally, we handsearched renal‐related journals and the proceedings of major renal conferences, and reviewed weekly current awareness alerts for selected renal journals. The date of the last search was 14 February 2017. There were no language restrictions. Selection criteria Randomized controlled trials of at least one year of MDI versus control for prevention of recurrent idiopathic (non‐syndromic) nephrolithiasis in children. Data collection and analysis We used standard methodologic procedures expected by Cochrane. Titles and abstracts were identified by search criteria and then screened for relevance, and then data extraction and risk of bias assessment were carried out. We assessed the quality of evidence using GRADE. Main results The search identified one study of 125 children (72 boys and 53 girls) with calcium‐containing idiopathic nephrolithiasis and normal renal morphology following initial treatment with shockwave lithotripsy (SWL). Patients were randomized to oral potassium citrate 1 mEq/kg per day for 12 months versus no specific medication or preventive measure with results reported for a total of 96 patients (48 per group). This included children who were stone‐free (n = 52) or had residual stone fragments (n = 44) following SWL. Primary outcomes: Medical therapy may lower rates of stone recurrence with a risk ratio (RR) of 0.19 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.06 to 0.60; low quality evidence). This corresponds to 270 fewer stone recurrences per 1000 (133 fewer to 313 fewer) children. We downgraded the quality of evidence by two levels for very serious study limitations related to unclear allocation concealment (selection bias) and a high risk of performance, detection and attrition bias. While the data for adverse events were incomplete, they reported that six of 48 (12.5%) children receiving potassium citrate left the trial because of adverse effects. This corresponds to a RR of 13.0 (95% CI 0.75 to 224.53; very low quality evidence); an absolute effect size estimate could not be generated. We downgraded the quality of evidence for study limitations and imprecision. We found no information on retreatment rates. Secondary outcomes: We found no evidence on serum electrolytes, 24‐hour urine collection parameters or time to new stone formation. We were unable to perform any preplanned secondary analyses. Authors' conclusions Oral potassium citrate supplementation may reduce recurrent calcium urinary stone formation in children following SWL; however, our confidence in this finding is limited. A substantial number of children stopped the medication due to adverse events. There is no trial evidence on retreatment rates. There is a critical need for additional well‐designed trials in children with nephrolithiasis. Plain language summary Medical and dietary interventions for preventing recurrent urinary stones in children Review question We performed this review to find out whether medicines or diet changes are better than no intervention at preventing children (up to 18 years of age) who had been treated for kidney stones from getting kidney stones again. Background Many children form kidney stones for unclear reasons and require treatment. Changes in what they eat and drink or medicines (or both) may help lower the risk of these children to get kidney stones again but we do not know how well this works and what the side effects are. Study characteristics We examined research published up to 14 February 2017. We looked for studies of boys and girls from age one to 18 years who sometime before had problems with kidney stones and who were assigned to a different diet or a medicine (or both) to stop the stones from coming back for at least 12 months. We were most interested in whether the stones returned, how many side effects there were and if children had to have more treatments for kidney stones. Key results We only found one small study with 125 children (72 boys and 53 girls) who had been treated with waves similar to those that carry sound, so‐called shock waves to treat their kidney stones. These children formed kidney stones for unknown reasons and had otherwise normal kidneys. Fifty‐two children had no more stones and 44 children still had small stone pieces left when they started the study. One group was given a medicine by mouth called potassium citrate; the other group was given no special medicine. The children were on this study for about two years. The study reported on the findings in 96 children; 48 in each group. Based on this study, we found that this medicine may result in stones coming back less often. However, we are not sure about this finding because the study was not of good quality and small. One in eight patients stopped the medicine because of side effects. We did not find any information on how often children had to be treated for stones again. Quality of the evidence The evidence quality for stones coming back less often was low and that for side effects very low. We found no evidence on how often children had to be treated for stones again.

AB  -  Abstract - Background Idiopathic hypercalciuria is an inherited metabolic abnormality that is characterised by excessive amounts of calcium excreted in the urine by people whose calcium serum levels are normal. Morbidity associated with idiopathic hypercalciuria is chiefly related to kidney stone disease and bone demineralisation leading to osteopenia and osteoporosis. Idiopathic hypercalciuria contributes to kidney stone disease at all life stages; people with the condition are prone to developing oxalate and calcium phosphate kidney stones. In some cases, crystallised calcium can be deposited in the renal interstitium, causing increased calcium levels in the kidneys. In children, idiopathic hypercalciuria can cause a range of comorbidities including recurrent macroscopic or microscopic haematuria, frequency dysuria syndrome, urinary tract infections and abdominal and lumbar pain. Various dietary interventions have been described that aim to decrease urinary calcium levels or urinary crystallisation. Objectives Our objectives were to assess the efficacy, effectiveness and safety of dietary interventions for preventing complications in idiopathic hypercalciuria (urolithiasis and osteopenia) in adults and children, and to assess the benefits of dietary interventions in decreasing urological symptomatology in children with idiopathic hypercalciuria. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Renal Group's Specialised Register (23 April 2013) through contact with the Trials' Search Co‐ordinator using search terms relevant to this review. Studies contained in the Specialised Register are identified through search strategies specifically designed for CENTRAL, MEDLINE and EMBASE. Selection criteria We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs that investigated dietary interventions aimed at preventing complications of idiopathic hypercalciuria, compared with placebo, no intervention, or other dietary interventions regardless of route of administration, dose or amount. Data collection and analysis Studies were assessed for inclusion and data extracted using a standardised data extraction form. We calculated risk ratios (RR) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MD) for continuous outcomes, both with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Main results We included five studies (379 adult participants) that investigated a range of interventions. Lack of similarity among interventions investigated meant that data could not be pooled. Overall, study methodology was not adequately reported in any of the included studies. There was a high risk of bias associated with blinding (although it seems unlikely that outcomes measures were unduly influenced by lack of intervention blinding), random sequence generation and allocation methodologies were unclear in most studies, but selective reporting bias was assessed as low. One study (120 participants) compared a low calcium diet with a normal calcium, low protein, low salt diet for five years. There was a significant decrease in numbers of new stone recurrences in those treated with the normal calcium, low protein, low salt diet (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.98). This diet also led to a significant decrease in oxaluria (MD 78.00 µmol/d, 95% CI 26.48 to 129.52) and the calcium oxalate relative supersaturation index (MD 1.20 95% CI 0.21 to 2.19). One study (210 participants) compared a low salt, normal calcium diet with a broad diet for three months. The low salt, normal calcium diet decreased urinary calcium (MD ‐45.00 mg/d, 95% CI ‐74.83 to ‐15.17) and oxalate excretion (MD ‐4.00 mg/d, 95% CI ‐6.44 to ‐1.56). A small study (17 participants) compared the effect of dietary fibre as part of a low calcium, low oxalate diet over three weeks, and found that although calciuria levels decreased, oxaluria increased. Phyllanthus niruri  plant substrate intake was investigated in a small subgroup with hypercalciuria (20 participants); there was no significant effect on calciuria levels occurred after three months of treatment. A small cross‐over study (12 participants) evaluating the changes in urinary supersaturation indices among patients who consumed calcium‐fortified orange juice or milk for one month found no benefits for participants. None of the studies reported any significant adverse effects associated with the interventions. Authors' conclusions Long‐term adherence (five years) to diets that feature normal levels of calcium, low protein and low salt may reduce numbers of stone recurrences, decrease oxaluria and calcium oxalate relative supersaturation indexes in people with idiopathic hypercalciuria who experience recurrent kidney stones. Adherence to a low salt, normal calcium level diet for some months can reduce calciuria and oxaluria. However, the other dietary interventions examined did not demonstrate evidence of significant beneficial effects. No studies were found investigating the effect of dietary recommendations on other clinical complications or asymptomatic idiopathic hypercalciuria. Plain language summary Dietary interventions for preventing complications in idiopathic hypercalciuria Hypercalciuria, an inherited metabolic condition, is the presence of excessive calcium in the urine. The cause is often unknown (idiopathic), and may occur in people who are otherwise well. Although people with the condition have normal levels of calcium in their blood, calcium is lost through the urine. Adults with hypercalciuria are prone to developing kidney stones and losing calcium from their bones. In children, hypercalciuria can cause blood in the urine (haematuria), frequency‐dysuria syndrome (frequent painful or difficult urination), urinary tract infections, abdominal and back pain. It has been suggested that altering the diets of people with hypercalciuria could help to prevent complications of the condition. We therefore aimed to evaluate the benefits and harms of dietary interventions that had been investigated in clinical studies. We included five studies in our review, one of which compared a low calcium diet with a diet that included normal levels of calcium, low protein, low salt over five years. This study found that diets unrestricted for calcium intake significantly decreased numbers of new kidney stones. Other dietary interventions, such as unprocessed wheat bran, did not show any evidence of beneficial effects. We did not find any studies in children, and none investigating specific dietary recommendations for those who had hypercalciuria without symptoms.

AB  -  Abstract - Background Maternal nutrition during pregnancy is known to have an effect on fetal growth and development. It is recommended that women increase their calcium intake during pregnancy and lactation, although the recommended dosage varies among professionals. Currently, there is no consensus on the role of routine calcium supplementation for pregnant women other than for preventing or treating hypertension. Objectives To determine the effect of calcium supplementation on maternal, fetal and neonatal outcomes, excluding women with multiple gestation (other than for preventing or treating hypertension), including the occurrence of adverse effects. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (which includes results of comprehensive searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, two trials registers and relevant conference proceedings) on 3 December 2022. We also searched the reference lists of retrieved studies. Selection criteria We considered all published, unpublished and ongoing randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing maternal, fetal and neonatal outcomes in pregnant women who received calcium supplementation versus placebo or no treatment. Cluster‐RCTs were eligible for inclusion but none were identified. Quasi‐RCTs and cross‐over studies were not eligible for inclusion. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion. At least one review author assessed trials meeting the inclusion criteria for trustworthiness, consulting another review author in cases that were not immediately clear. Two review authors independently assessed the studies for risk of bias, extracted data, and checked trials for accuracy. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE. Main results Twenty‐one studies met the inclusion criteria, but only 19 studies contributed data to the review. These 19 trials recruited 17,370 women, with 16,625 women included in the final analyses. The trials were generally at low risk of bias for randomisation and allocation concealment. We chose three outcomes for GRADE assessment: preterm birth less than 37 weeks, preterm birth less than 34 weeks and low birthweight (less than 2500 g). All trials compared calcium supplementation with placebo or no treatment with 17 trials comparing high‐dose calcium (greater than 1000 mg/day). Calcium supplementation probably slightly reduces the risk of preterm birth less than 37 weeks (average risk ratio (RR) 0.80, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.65 to 0.99; 11 trials, 15,379 women; moderate‐certainty evidence), but probably has little effect on the risk of preterm birth less than 34 weeks (average RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.35; 3 trials, 5569 women; moderate‐certainty evidence), and may have little or no effect on low birthweight (less than 2500 g) (average RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.07; 6 trials, 14,162 women; low‐certainty evidence; 1 study reported low birthweight (less than 2500 g) but recorded 0 events in both groups. Thus, the RR and CIs were calculated from 5 studies rather than 6). We downgraded the evidence for imprecision (wide CIs crossing the line of no effect) and inconsistency (high levels of heterogeneity between the studies). There was no evidence that calcium supplementation had any effect on maternal weight gain during pregnancy; increasing bone mineral density in pregnant women; rate of intrauterine growth restriction; perinatal mortality; stillbirth or fetal death rate; increase birth length or fetal head circumference; and adverse effects such as postpartum haemorrhage, gall stones, gastrointestinal symptoms, headache, urinary stones, urinary tract infection or impaired renal function. Authors' conclusions This review indicates that calcium supplementation probably reduces preterm birth before 37 weeks. There are no clear additional benefits to calcium supplementation in preterm birth before 34 weeks or prevention of low birthweight. Large multicentre trials to detect the effect of calcium supplementation on fetal birthweight and preterm birth before 34 weeks as the primary outcomes are needed. Further research into the short‐ and long‐term effects of calcium supplementation would also be beneficial. Plain language summary Do calcium supplements during pregnancy improve the health of babies and mothers (omitting studies on high blood pressure) Key messages – Taking high doses (more than 1000 mg) of calcium supplements during pregnancy may lead to slightly fewer babies being born before 37 weeks of pregnancy. There was possibly no difference in unwanted effects, though we found few data for this. – There appeared to be no reduction in the number of babies born before 34 weeks of pregnancy or the number of babies with low birthweight. These are the babies whose health is more severely affected by being born early. – The impact of mothers taking calcium supplements during pregnancy on babies' and mother's health is likely to be small, if at all. Further studies are needed to be more sure of the data and any unwanted effects. Why are calcium supplements taken during pregnancy? Pregnant women are often advised to take extra calcium but different health professionals often recommend different doses. Calcium is really important for babies' growth and development in the womb. Extra calcium may improve babies' health and might also affect mothers themselves. Extra calcium may help the pregnancy to continue and reduce the number of babies born early (preterm, also known as premature). However, there may be unwanted effects too. Babies born preterm (at less than 37 weeks' gestation (that is, 37 weeks since the woman's last period)) have more health issues compared with babies born at their due date (term). This is particularly so for babies born less than 34 weeks' gestation (or babies of low birthweight) who can have serious health problems. So if calcium supplements could reduce the number of babies born preterm this may have an impact on the health of babies. What did we want to find out? We asked if calcium supplements taken by mothers during pregnancy reduced the number of babies born too early (preterm) or reduced the number of babies with low birthweight (less than 2500 g). We also asked if there might be any unwanted effects on either babies or their mothers. We excluded studies on mothers with high blood pressure as this is covered by other Cochrane reviews. What did we do? This is an update of a review first published in 2015. We found 19 studies with data for our review, which involved 16,625 mothers and their babies. The studies were undertaken in a large number of countries. The biggest study involved 8325 mothers and babies, and the smallest study involved 23 mothers and babies. The included studies were generally of good quality, were mostly of high‐dose calcium and we are reasonably confident in the data we have. We found that calcium supplements probably leads to slightly fewer babies born before 37 weeks (11 studies, 15,379 mothers and babies). However, we found there was probably no difference in the number of babies born before 34 weeks (3 studies, 5569 mothers and babies). There may be little to no effect on low birthweight (6 studies, 14,162 women and babies). Mothers who took extra calcium reported similar unwanted effects as those mothers who did not take any extra calcium. However, only a few studies reported on unwanted effects. What are the limitations of the evidence? Our confidence in the evidence is only moderate because the effect of calcium appeared to differ slightly between studies. The studies were also limited to only high doses of calcium and few studies reported on unwanted effects. How up to date is this evidence? This review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to December 2022.

AB  -  Abstract - Background Several dietary factors have been considered to be involved in the increasing incidence of colorectal cancer in industrialised countries. Experimental and epidemiological evidence has been suggestive but not conclusive for a protective role for high dietary calcium intake. Intervention studies with colorectal cancer as an endpoint are difficult to perform owing to the large number of patients and the long follow‐up required; studies using the appearance of colorectal adenomatous polyps as a surrogate endpoint are therefore considered in reviewing the existing evidence. Objectives This systematic review aims to assess the effect of supplementary dietary calcium on the incidence of colorectal cancer and the incidence or recurrence of adenomatous polyps. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, the Cochrane Colorectal Cancer Group specialised register, MEDLINE, Cancerlit , and Embase, to December 2009. The reference lists of identified studies were inspected for further studies, and the review literature was scrutinized. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials of the effects of dietary calcium on the development of colonic cancer and adenomatous polyps in humans are reviewed. Studies of healthy adults and studies of adults at higher risk of colon cancer due to family history, previous adenomatous polyps, or inflammatory bowel disease were considered; data from subjects with familial polyposis coli are excluded. The primary outcomes were the occurrence of colon cancer, and occurrence or recurrence of any new adenomas of the colon. Secondary outcomes were any adverse event that required discontinuation of calcium supplementation, and drop‐outs before the end of the study. Data collection and analysis Two reviewers independently extracted data, assessed trial quality and resolved discrepancies by consensus. The outcomes were reported as odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). The data were combined with the fixed effects model. Main results Two studies with 1346 subjects met the inclusion criteria. Both trials were well designed, double ‐ blind, placebo controlled trials, included participants with previous adenomas. The doses of supplementary elemental calcium used were 1200 mg daily for a mean duration of 4 years, and 2000 mg/day for three years.The rates of loss to follow ‐up were 14 % and 11%.   For the development of recurrent colorectal adenoma, a reduction was found (OR 0.74, CI 0.58,0.95) when the results from both trials were combined. Authors' conclusions Although the evidence from two RCTs suggests that calcium supplementation might contribute to a moderate degree to the prevention of colorectal adenomatous polyps, this does not constitute sufficient evidence to recommend the general use of calcium supplements to prevent colorectal cancer. Plain language summary Daily intake of 1 gr dietary calcium may have moderate protective effect on development of colorectal adenomatous polyps There have been suggestions, based on observational studies and on laboratory markers, that dietary calcium may protect against colorectal cancer. This systematic review of the literature identified two well conducted randomised placebo‐controlled intervention studies involving 1346 subjects followed for 3‐4 years. The results suggest that there may be a moderate protective effect (OR 0.74; CI 0.58,0.95) for dietary supplementation of at least 1200mg elemental calcium per day on the development of colorectal adenomatous polyps. However, no trial has directly demonstrated an effect of calcium supplementation on the development of colorectal cancer itself.

AB  -  Abstract - Background Obesity is a major health problem worldwide as it can lead to high blood pressure, heart disease, stroke, diabetes, and insulin resistance. The prevalence of overweight and obesity is increasing worldwide across different age groups. There is evidence of an inverse relationship between calcium intake and body weight. The clinical relevance of a small reduction in body weight has been questioned. However, at a population level, a small effect could mitigate the observed global trends. Objectives To assess the effects of calcium supplementation on weight loss in individuals living with overweight or obesity. Search methods We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS (Latin American and Caribbean Health Science Information database), and two clinical trials registries. The date of the last search of all databases (except Embase) was 10 May 2023. No language restrictions were applied. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials evaluating the effect of calcium in participants with overweight or obesity of any age or gender. We excluded studies in participants with absorption problems. We included studies of any dose with a minimum duration of two months. We included the following comparisons: calcium supplementation versus placebo, calcium‐fortified food or beverage versus placebo, or calcium‐fortified food or beverage versus non‐calcium‐fortified food or beverage. We excluded studies that evaluated the effect of calcium and vitamin D or mixed minerals compared to placebo. Data collection and analysis We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Our primary outcomes were body weight, health‐related quality of life, and adverse events. Our secondary outcomes were anthropometric measures other than body weight, all‐cause mortality, and morbidity. Main results We found 18 studies that evaluated the effect of calcium compared to placebo or control, with a total of 1873 randomised participants (950 participants in the calcium supplementation groups and 923 in the control groups). All included studies gave oral calcium supplementation as the intervention. We did not find any studies evaluating calcium‐fortified foods. We excluded 38 studies, identified four ongoing studies, and listed one study as 'awaiting classification'. Sixteen studies compared calcium supplementation to placebo; two studies compared different doses of calcium supplementation. Doses ranged from very low (0.162 g of calcium/day) to high (1.5 g of calcium/day). Most studies were performed in the USA and Iran, lasted less than six months, and included only women. Low‐certainty evidence suggests that calcium supplementation compared to placebo or control may result in little to no difference in body weight (mean difference (MD) ‐0.15 kg, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐0.55 to 0.24; P = 0.45, I 2  = 46%; 17 studies, 1317 participants; low‐certainty evidence). We downgraded the certainty of the evidence by two levels for risk of bias and heterogeneity. None of the included studies reported health‐related quality of life, all‐cause mortality, or morbidity/complications as outcomes. Only five studies assessed or reported adverse events. Low‐certainty evidence suggests a low frequency of adverse events, with no clear difference between intervention and control groups. Moderate‐certainty evidence shows that calcium supplementation compared to placebo or control probably results in a small reduction in body mass index (BMI) (MD ‐0.18 kg/m 2 ,95% CI ‐0.22 to ‐0.13; P < 0.001, I 2  = 0%; 9 studies, 731 participants) and waist circumference (MD ‐0.51 cm, 95% CI ‐0.72 to ‐0.29; P < 0.001, I 2  = 0%; 6 studies, 273 participants). Low‐certainty evidence suggests that calcium supplementation compared to placebo or control may result in a small reduction in body fat mass (MD ‐0.34 kg, 95% CI ‐0.73 to 0.05; P < 0.001, I 2  = 97%; 12 studies, 812 participants). Authors' conclusions Calcium supplementation for eight weeks to 24 months may result in little to no difference in body weight in people with overweight or obesity. The current evidence is of low certainty, due to concerns regarding risk of bias and statistical heterogeneity. We found that the degree of heterogeneity might be partly explained by calcium dosage, the presence or absence of a co‐intervention, and whether an intention‐to‐treat analysis was pursued. While our analyses suggest that calcium supplementation may result in a small reduction in BMI, waist circumference, and fat mass, this evidence is of low to moderate certainty. Future studies could investigate the effect of calcium supplementation on lean body mass to explore if there is a change in body composition. Plain language summary Do calcium supplements help people with overweight or obesity lose weight? Key messages ‐ Calcium supplements may make little to no difference in reducing overall body weight in people with overweight, or obesity, compared to sham calcium supplements (i.e. placebo). ‐ Calcium supplements probably lead to a small reduction in body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference. ‐ More high‐quality research is needed to provide clearer insights into the connection between calcium supplements and body weight. What is obesity? Overweight and obesity are defined as excessive fat accumulation that presents a risk to health. A body mass index (BMI) over 25 is considered overweight, and over 30 is obese. People with overweight and obesity have a higher risk of having high blood pressure, cardiovascular diseases, and diabetes. Obesity is a significant global health concern. What is calcium supplementation? Calcium is a mineral the body needs to build and maintain strong bones and carry out other important functions. Calcium supplementation involves taking calcium through oral supplements, such as tablets or foods and drinks with added calcium. What did we want to find out? We wanted to find out if calcium supplements or calcium‐fortified foods help people with overweight or obesity to lose weight. We also wanted to find out if calcium supplements were associated with any unwanted effects. What did we do? We searched for studies that investigated the effects of calcium supplements in people with overweight, and obesity. We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. What did we find? We found 18 studies involving 1873 participants. All the studies gave participants calcium tablets of varying doses. We did not find any studies evaluating calcium‐fortified foods or drinks. The studies included adults from 18 to 80 years old. Ten of the 18 studies included only women, and across all the studies, most of the participants were female. Eight studies were conducted in the USA, six in Iran, one each in Brazil, China, and Puerto Rico, and one study was carried out in centres in Argentina, Zimbabwe, and South Africa. ‐ Our findings suggest that calcium supplements may have little to no effect on reducing overall body weight, compared to not taking supplements.  ‐ Calcium supplements probably lead to a small reduction in body mass index (or BMI, a measure of body fat based on height and weight that applies to adult men and women) and waist circumference.  ‐ Calcium supplements may result in a small reduction in body fat mass (also known as 'stored fat'. The body uses it for energy; it insulates your body, surrounds your organs, and is just under your skin). Only five studies investigated if calcium supplements had any unwanted effects. Results from these studies suggest there were few unwanted effects, with no clear difference between those given calcium supplements and those not given supplements. None of the included studies assessed three of the review's outcomes: participants' health‐related quality of life, death by any cause, or illnesses and complications. What are the limitations of the evidence? Overall, we have little confidence in the evidence because of the small size of many studies, variations in results amongst the studies, and a lack of clarity in reporting certain aspects, such as how participants were allocated to groups in some of the studies. How up‐to‐date is this evidence? This evidence is current to 10 May 2023.

AB  -  Abstract - Background Hypertension is a major public health problem that increases the risk of cardiovascular and kidney diseases. Several studies have shown an inverse association between calcium intake and blood pressure, as small reductions in blood pressure have been shown to produce rapid reductions in vascular disease risk even in individuals with normal blood pressure ranges. This is the first update of the review to evaluate the effect of calcium supplementation in normotensive individuals as a preventive health measure. Objectives To assess the efficacy and safety of calcium supplementation versus placebo or control for reducing blood pressure in normotensive people and for the prevention of primary hypertension. Search methods The Cochrane Hypertension Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomised controlled trials up to September 2020: the Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register, CENTRAL (2020, Issue 9), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and the US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register, ClinicalTrials.gov. We also contacted authors of relevant papers regarding further published and unpublished work. The searches had no language restrictions. Selection criteria We selected trials that randomised normotensive people to dietary calcium interventions such as supplementation or food fortification versus placebo or control. We excluded quasi‐random designs. The primary outcomes were hypertension (defined as blood pressure ≥ 140/90 mmHg) and blood pressure measures. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion, abstracted the data and assessed the risks of bias. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of evidence. Main results The 2020 updated search identified four new trials. We included a total of 20 trials with 3512 participants, however we only included 18 for the meta‐analysis with 3140 participants. None of the studies reported hypertension as a dichotomous outcome. The effect on systolic and diastolic blood pressure was: mean difference (MD) ‐1.37 mmHg, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐2.08, ‐0.66; 3140 participants; 18 studies; I 2  = 0%, high‐certainty evidence; and MD ‐1.45, 95% CI ‐2.23, ‐0.67; 3039 participants; 17 studies; I 2  = 45%, high‐certainty evidence, respectively. The effect on systolic and diastolic blood pressure for those younger than 35 years was: MD ‐1.86, 95% CI ‐3.45, ‐0.27; 452 participants; eight studies; I 2  = 19%, moderate‐certainty evidence; MD ‐2.50, 95% CI ‐4.22, ‐0.79; 351 participants; seven studies ; I 2  = 54%, moderate‐certainty evidence, respectively. The effect on systolic and diastolic blood pressure for those 35 years or older was: MD ‐0.97, 95% CI ‐1.83, ‐0.10; 2688 participants; 10 studies; I 2  = 0%, high‐certainty evidence; MD ‐0.59, 95% CI ‐1.13, ‐0.06; 2688 participants; 10 studies; I 2  = 0%, high‐certainty evidence, respectively. The effect on systolic and diastolic blood pressure for women was: MD ‐1.25, 95% CI ‐2.53, 0.03; 1915 participants; eight studies; I 2  = 0%, high‐certainty evidence; MD ‐1.04, 95% CI ‐1.86, ‐0.22; 1915 participants; eight studies; I 2  = 4%, high‐certainty evidence, respectively. The effect on systolic and diastolic blood pressure for men was MD ‐2.14, 95% CI ‐3.71, ‐0.59; 507 participants; five studies; I 2  = 8%, moderate‐certainty evidence; MD ‐1.99, 95% CI ‐3.25, ‐0.74; 507 participants; five studies; I 2  = 41%, moderate‐certainty evidence, respectively. The effect was consistent in both genders regardless of baseline calcium intake. The effect on systolic blood pressure was: MD ‐0.02, 95% CI ‐2.23, 2.20; 302 participants; 3 studies; I 2  = 0%, moderate‐certainty evidence with doses less than 1000 mg; MD ‐1.05, 95% CI ‐1.91, ‐0.19; 2488 participants; 9 studies; I 2  = 0%, high‐certainty evidence with doses 1000 to 1500 mg; and MD ‐2.79, 95% CI ‐4.71, 0.86; 350 participants; 7 studies; I 2  = 0%, moderate‐certainty evidence with doses more than 1500 mg. The effect on diastolic blood pressure was: MD ‐0.41, 95% CI ‐2.07, 1.25; 201 participants; 2 studies; I 2  = 0, moderate‐certainty evidence; MD ‐2.03, 95% CI ‐3.44, ‐0.62 ; 1017 participants; 8 studies; and MD ‐1.35, 95% CI ‐2.75, ‐0.05; 1821 participants; 8 studies; I 2  = 51%, high‐certainty evidence, respectively. None of the studies reported adverse events. Authors' conclusions An increase in calcium intake slightly reduces both systolic and diastolic blood pressure in normotensive people, particularly in young people, suggesting a role in the prevention of hypertension. The effect across multiple prespecified subgroups and a possible dose response effect reinforce this conclusion. Even small reductions in blood pressure could have important health implications for reducing vascular disease. A 2 mmHg lower systolic blood pressure is predicted to produce about 10% lower stroke mortality and about 7% lower mortality from ischaemic heart disease. There is a great need for adequately‐powered clinical trials randomising young people. Subgroup analysis should involve basal calcium intake, age, sex, basal blood pressure, and body mass index. We also require assessment of side effects, optimal doses and the best strategy to improve calcium intake. Plain language summary Extra calcium to prevent high blood pressure Review question We wanted to find out the effects of calcium intake on blood pressure in people with normal blood pressure. Background Hypertension is a serious health problem that increases the risk of heart and kidney diseases. Several studies have shown that increasing calcium intake lowers blood pressure even in individuals within a normal blood pressure range. Increasing calcium intake also has benefits for pregnancy outcomes, effects which are thought to be mediated also by blood pressure reduction. High blood pressure has been identified as a major risk factor for mortality and even small reductions in blood pressure can decrease the occurrence of coronary artery disease, stroke and death. Study characteristics We selected studies that assessed the effect of dietary calcium interventions such as supplementation or food fortification on blood pressure in normotensive people of all ages. Searches were last run in September 2020. Key findings This review analysed information from 20 trials of which 18 trials (3140participants) provided date for the effect of the intervention. We found that an increase in calcium intake slightly reduces both systolic and diastolic blood pressure by 1.37 mmHg lower and by 1.45 mmHg lower, respectively. This effect was higher with doses of calcium above 1000 mg/day. Systolic blood pressure was reduced by 1.05 mmHg with doses of calcium 1000 to 1500 mg/day and by 2.79 mmHg with doses of calcium equal to or over 1500 mg/day. We noted a reduction in blood pressure in both men and women and at ages from 11 to 82 years old, but the reduction was greater among younger people. Systolic blood pressure was reduced by 1.86 mmHg among those less than 35 years and by 0.97 mmHg among those 35 years or older. None of the studies reported adverse events. We need further research to determine the ideal dosage of supplementation and whether it is more effective and safer as part of the diet or as a supplement. Quality of the evidence We found high quality of evidence for systolic and diastolic blood pressure in both men and women. The quality of evidence was also high for participants 35 years or older and moderate for younger people. The quality of evidence was high for doses of calcium of 1000 to 1500 mg/day and was moderate for lower or higher doses. Five of the 18 trials were industry funded.

AB  -  Abstract - Background Nutritional rickets is a disease which affects children, especially in low‐ and middle‐income countries. It causes problems such as skeletal deformities and impaired growth. The most common cause of nutritional rickets is vitamin D deficiency. Vitamin D administered with or without calcium is commonly regarded as the mainstay of treatment. In some sunny countries, however, where children are believed to have adequate vitamin D production from exposure to ultraviolet light, but who are deficient in calcium due to low dietary intake, calcium alone has also been used in the treatment of nutritional rickets. Therefore, it is important to compare the effects of vitamin D, calcium or a combination of vitamin D and calcium for the treatment of nutritional rickets in children living in different settings. Objectives To assess the effects of vitamin D, calcium or a combination of vitamin D and calcium for the treatment of nutritional rickets in children. Search methods We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, LILACS, WHO ICTRP Search Portal and ClinicalTrials.gov. The date of the last search of all databases was 25 July 2019. We applied no language restrictions. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCT) involving children aged 0 to 18 years with nutritional rickets which compared treatment with vitamin D, calcium or a combination of vitamin D and calcium. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently screened the title and abstracts of all studies, extracted data and assessed the risk of bias of included studies. We resolved any disagreements by consensus or recourse to a third review author. We conducted meta‐analyses for the outcomes reported by study authors. For dichotomous outcomes, we calculated the risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) and, for continuous outcomes, we calculated mean differences (MD) with 95% CIs. We assessed the certainty of the evidence of the included studies using GRADE. Main results We identified 4562 studies; of these, we included four RCTs with 286 participants. The studies compared two or more of the following: vitamin D, calcium or vitamin D plus calcium. The number of participants randomised to receive vitamin D was 64, calcium was 102 and vitamin D plus calcium was 120. Two studies were conducted in India and two were conducted in Nigeria. None of the included studies had a low risk of bias in all domains. Three studies had a high risk of bias in at least one domain. The age of the participants ranged between six months and 14 years. The duration of follow‐up ranged between 12 weeks and 24 weeks. Two studies compared vitamin D to calcium. There is low‐certainty evidence that, at 24 weeks' follow‐up, calcium alone improved the healing of rickets compared to vitamin D alone (RR 3.26, 95% CI 1.59 to 6.69; P = 0.001; 1 study, 71 participants). Comparing vitamin D to calcium showed no firm evidence of an advantage or disadvantage in reducing morbidity (fractures) (RR 0.27, 95% CI 0.03 to 2.32; P = 0.23; 1 study, 71 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). Adverse events were not reported. Two studies compared vitamin D plus calcium to vitamin D at 12 or 24 weeks. Vitamin D plus calcium improved healing of rickets compared to vitamin D alone at 24 weeks' follow‐up (RR 3.06, 95% CI 1.49 to 6.29; P = 0.002; 1 study, 75 participants; low‐certainty evidence). There is no conclusive evidence in favour of either intervention for reducing morbidity (fractures) (RR 0.24, 95% CI 0.03 to 2.08; P = 0.20; 1 study, 71 participants; very low‐certainty evidence) or adverse events (RR 4.76, 95% CI 0.24 to 93.19; P = 0.30; 1 study, 39 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). All four included studies compared vitamin D plus calcium to calcium at different follow‐up times. There is no conclusive evidence on whether vitamin D plus calcium in comparison to calcium alone improved healing of rickets at 24 weeks' follow‐up (RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.90; P = 0.53; 2 studies, 140 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). Evidence is also inconclusive for morbidity (fractures) (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.06 to 13.76; P = 0.94; 1 study, 72 participants; very low‐certainty evidence) and adverse events (RR 4.29, 0.22 to 83.57; P = 0.34; 1 study, 37 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). Most of the evidence in the review is low or very low certainty due to risk of bias, imprecision or both. None of the included studies assessed all‐cause mortality, health‐related quality of life or socioeconomic effects. One study assessed growth pattern but this was not measured at the time‐point stipulated in the protocol of our review (one or more years after commencement of therapy). Authors' conclusions This review provides low‐certainty evidence that vitamin D plus calcium or calcium alone improve healing in children with nutritional rickets compared to vitamin D alone. We are unable to make conclusions on the effects of the interventions on adverse events or morbidity (fractures). Plain language summary Vitamin D, calcium or a combination of vitamin D and calcium for the treatment of nutritional rickets in children Review question To assess the effects of vitamin D, calcium or a combination of vitamin D and calcium for the treatment of nutritional rickets in children. Background Nutritional rickets is a disease of the bones that affects mostly children in low‐ and middle‐income countries. Children with nutritional rickets typically have deformed bones, may not grow well and experience other health problems. A lack of vitamin D is the most common cause of nutritional rickets. As such, nutritional rickets is usually treated by giving the child vitamin D with or without calcium. In some sunny countries, however, calcium alone has been used to treat nutritional rickets in children who are believed to have adequate vitamin D from their exposure to sunlight but who lack adequate calcium in their diet. This review was conducted to find out whether vitamin D, calcium or a combination of vitamin D and calcium is best for the treatment of nutritional rickets in children. Study characteristics We found four randomised controlled trials (clinical trials where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) that compared vitamin D, calcium or a combination of vitamin D and calcium for the treatment of nutritional rickets in children. The 286 children in the studies were aged six months to 14 years. Following treatment, the children were monitored for between 12 and 24 weeks. This evidence is up to date as of 25 July 2019. Key results We found evidence that using calcium alone or vitamin D plus calcium to treat nutritional rickets may improve healing when compared to using vitamin D alone. We are uncertain about the effects on fractures of calcium alone compared to vitamin D alone. We are uncertain about the effects on fractures or other side effects of vitamin D plus calcium compared to vitamin D alone. We are uncertain about the effects of vitamin D plus calcium compared to calcium alone on healing of rickets, fractures and side effects. None of the studies reported on growth pattern (differences in height, weight, height for age, weight for age), death from any cause, socioeconomic effects (cost of treatment, resources lost due to illness or due to absence of the caregiver from work, cost of visits to hospital or health facility) and health‐related quality of life. Reliability of the evidence The reliability of the evidence for all the outcomes in our review is low or very low. The reason for the uncertainty is mostly due to the low number of participants in the studies and the low number of studies included in the review. Imprecise results and the potential to arrive at wrong conclusions because of the way the trials were conducted in some of the studies also contributed to the level of uncertainty.

AB  -  Abstract - Background Vitamin D deficiency during pregnancy increases the risk of pre‐eclampsia, gestational diabetes, preterm birth, and low birthweight. In a previous Cochrane Review we found that supplementing pregnant women with vitamin D alone compared to no vitamin D supplementation may reduce the risk of pre‐eclampsia, gestational diabetes, and low birthweight and may increase the risk of preterm births if it is combined with calcium. However the effects of different vitamin D regimens are not yet clear. Objectives To assess the effects and safety of different regimens of vitamin D supplementation alone or in combination with calcium or other vitamins, minerals or nutrients during pregnancy, specifically doses of 601 international units per day (IU/d) or more versus 600 IU/d or less; and 4000 IU/d or more versus 3999 IU/d or less. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth’s Trials Register,  ClinicalTrials.gov , the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform ( ICTRP ) (12 July 2018), and the reference lists of retrieved studies. Selection criteria Randomised trials evaluating the effect of different vitamin D regimens (dose, frequency, duration, and time of commencement of supplementation during pregnancy), alone or in combination with other nutrients on pregnancy and neonatal health outcomes. We only included trials that compared 601 IU/d or more versus 600 IU/d or less and 4000 IU/d or more versus 3999 IU/d or less. We did not include in the analysis groups that received no vitamin D, as that comparison is assessed in another Cochrane Review. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently: i) assessed the eligibility of studies against the inclusion criteria; ii) extracted data from included studies, and iii) assessed the risk of bias of the included studies. Our primary maternal outcomes were: pre‐eclampsia, gestational diabetes, and any adverse effects; our primary infant outcomes were preterm birth and low birthweight. Data were checked for accuracy. The certainty of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach. Main results In this review, we included data from 30 trials involving 7289 women. We excluded 11 trials, identified 16 ongoing/unpublished trials and two trials are awaiting classification. Overall risk of bias for the trials was mixed. Comparison 1. 601 IU/d or more versus 600 IU/d or less of vitamin D alone or with any other nutrient (19 trials; 5214 participants) Supplementation with 601 IU/d or more of vitamin D during pregnancy may make little or no difference to the risk of pre‐eclampsia (risk ratio (RR) 0.96, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.65 to 1.42); 5 trials; 1553 participants, l ow‐ certainty evidence ), may reduce the risk of gestational diabetes (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.86; 5 trials; 1846 participants;  moderate‐certainty evidence ), may make little or no difference to the risk of preterm birth (RR 1.25, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.69; 4 trials; 2294 participants;  low‐certainty evidence ); and may make little or no difference to the risk of low birthweight (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.24; 4 trials; 1550 participants;  very low‐certainty evidence ) compared to women receiving 600 IU/d or less. Comparison 2. 4000 IU or more versus 3999 IU or less of vitamin D alone (15 trials; 4763 participants) Supplementation with 4000 IU/d or more of vitamin D during pregnancy may make little or no difference to the risk of: pre‐eclampsia (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.22; 4 trials, 1903 participants,  low‐certainty evidence ); gestational diabetes (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.42; 5 trials, 2276 participants;  low‐certainty evidence ); preterm birth (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.12; 6 trials, 2948 participants,  low‐certainty evidence ); and low birthweight (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.70; 2 trials; 1099 participants;  low‐certainty evidence ) compared to women receiving 3999 IU/d or less. Adverse events (such as hypercalcaemia, hypocalcaemia, hypercalciuria, and hypovitaminosis D) were reported differently in most trials; however, in general, there was little to no side effects reported or similar cases between groups. Authors' conclusions Supplementing pregnant women with more than the current vitamin D recommendation may reduce the risk of gestational diabetes; however, it may make little or no difference to the risk of pre‐eclampsia, preterm birth and low birthweight. Supplementing pregnant women with more than the current upper limit for vitamin D seems not to increase the risk of the outcomes evaluated. In general, the GRADE was considered low certainty for most of the primary outcomes due to serious risk of bias and imprecision of results. With respect to safety, it appears that vitamin D supplementation is a safe intervention during pregnancy, although the parameters used to determine this were either not reported or not consistent between trials. Future trials should be consistent in their reports of adverse events. There are 16 ongoing trials that when published, will increase the body of knowledge. Plain language summary Regimens of vitamin D supplementation for women during pregnancy What is the issue? This review evaluated if there are beneficial effects of supplementing pregnant women with more than the current vitamin D recommendation (200 international units/day (IU/d) to 600 IU/d) on pregnancy and neonatal health outcomes and to evaluate if there are negative health effects when using more than the current upper limit recommendation (4000 IU/d). Why is this important? Vitamin D supplementation in pregnancy compared to no supplementation appears to decrease the risk of pre‐eclampsia, gestational diabetes, low birthweight and may reduce the risk of severe postpartum haemorrhage. However, it is not clear if doses greater than the currently recommended level are needed to observe these health benefits, and if giving more than the upper limit is related to adverse events. What was studied in the review? This review included trials evaluating the effect of different vitamin D regimens (doses, frequencies, duration, and times of commencement) to compare the effects of 601 IU/d or more versus 600 IU/d or less and 4000 IU/d or more versus 3999 IU/d or less, of vitamin D alone or with any other nutrient on pregnancy and neonatal health outcomes. What evidence did we find? Evidence from 19 trials involving 5214 women suggest that supplementation with 601 IU/d or more of vitamin D during pregnancy may reduce the risk of gestational diabetes but may make little or no difference to the risk of pre‐eclampsia, preterm birth or low birthweight compared to women receiving 600 IU/d or less. Evidence from 15 trials involving 4763 women suggests that supplementation with 4000 IU/d or more of vitamin D during pregnancy may make little or no difference to the risk of pre‐eclampsia, gestational diabetes, preterm birth or low birthweight compared to women receiving 3999 IU/d or less. Adverse events were reported differently in most trials; in general, there was little to no side effects reported or similar cases between groups. What does this mean? Supplementing pregnant women with more than the current vitamin D recommendation may reduce the risk of gestational diabetes; however, it may make little or no difference in the risk of the other outcomes. Supplementing pregnant women with more than the current upper limit for vitamin D seems not to increase the risk of the outcomes evaluated. Vitamin D supplementation appears to be safe.

AB  -  Abstract - Background Minocycline is an oral antibiotic used for acne vulgaris. Its use has lessened due to safety concerns (including potentially irreversible pigmentation), a relatively high cost, and no evidence of any greater benefit than other acne treatments. A modified‐release version of minocycline is being promoted as having fewer side‐effects. Objectives To assess new evidence on the effects of minocycline for acne vulgaris. Search methods Searches were updated in the following databases to November 2011: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL in  The Cochrane Library , MEDLINE (from 1946), EMBASE (from 1974), and LILACS (from 1982). We also searched trials registers and checked reference lists for further references to relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs). The Cochrane Skin Group's Trials Search Co‐ordinator undertook searches exploring minocycline's adverse effects in EMBASE and MEDLINE in February 2012. Selection criteria We selected randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing minocycline, at any dose, to an active or a placebo control, in participants with inflammatory acne vulgaris. For adverse effects, we selected additional studies that reported the number of adverse effects and the number of participants treated. Data collection and analysis Outcome measures used in the trials included lesion counts, acne grades/severity scores, doctors' and participants' global assessments, adverse effects, and dropout rates. Two authors independently assessed the quality of each study. Effect sizes were calculated, and meta‐analyses were undertaken where possible. Sixteen studies met the inclusion criteria for the review of adverse effects. Main results We included 12 new RCTs for this update, giving a total of 39 RCTs (6013 participants). These additional 12 RCTs have not changed the original conclusions about the clinical efficacy of minocycline. The identified RCTs were generally small and poor quality. Meta‐analysis was rarely possible because of the lack of data and different outcome measures and trial durations. Although minocycline was shown to be an effective treatment for moderate to moderately‐severe acne vulgaris, there was no evidence that it is better than any of the other commonly‐used acne treatments. One company‐sponsored RCT found minocycline to be less effective than combination treatment with topical erythromycin and zinc. No trials have been conducted using minocycline in those participants whose acne is resistant to other therapies. Also, there is no evidence to guide what dose should be used. The adverse effects studies must be interpreted with caution. The evidence suggests that minocycline is associated with more severe adverse effects than doxycycline. Minocycline, but not other tetracyclines, is associated with lupus erythematosus, but the risk is small: 8.8 cases per 100,000 person‐years. The risk of autoimmune reactions increases with duration of use. The evidence does not support the conclusion that the more expensive extended‐release preparation is safer than standard minocycline preparations. Authors' conclusions Minocycline is an effective treatment for moderate to moderately‐severe inflammatory acne vulgaris, but there is still no evidence that it is superior to other commonly‐used therapies. This review found no reliable evidence to justify the reinstatement of its first‐line use, even though the price‐differential is less than it was 10 years ago. Concerns remain about its safety compared to other tetracyclines. Plain language summary Minocycline for acne vulgaris: efficacy and safety Acne is the most common skin disease of adolescence, and in most cases it clears spontaneously. However, in some people it persists in to adulthood. There are many different treatment options, but there is little good evidence to inform doctors and individuals about which to choose. Minocycline was the most prescribed antibiotic used to treat acne because it was thought to be better than other options, despite the original version of this review finding no reliable evidence that it was any better than other treatments. Over recent years it has been used less, which was due to serious concerns about its safety, including skin pigmentation, which in some cases is irreversible. It was also more expensive than other treatments. Since the first version of this review, minocycline's cost has fallen. In the UK, the daily cost of generic minocycline is now one third the cost of tetracycline. This update was undertaken to identify whether there was any new evidence that might change the conclusions of the original review or provide information on risks associated with minocycline therapy. Twelve new RCTs were identified, making a total of 39 RCTs (6013 participants). In summary, there is no evidence to support the first‐line use of minocycline in the treatment of acne. All of the trials showed that, on average, people treated with minocycline experienced an improvement in their acne. However, no study conclusively showed any important clinical difference between minocycline or other commonly‐used therapies. The analysis found that minocycline may act more quickly than oxytetracycline or tetracycline, but there is no overall difference in the end. There is no evidence that it is more effective in acne that is resistant to other therapies, or that the effects last longer. Although it is often claimed that the more expensive once‐daily slow‐release preparation is a more attractive option to teenagers with acne, the evidence in this review does not show it to be any better or safer compared to other oral antibiotics that have to be taken more frequently. Despite a thorough search for evidence, it is still not known which of the tetracyclines are the safest to take overall as they are all associated with side‐effects. The only conclusion that we could make was that people treated with minocycline for acne are at a significantly greater risk of developing an autoimmune (lupus‐like) syndrome than those given tetracycline or no treatment.

AB  -  Abstract - Background Chronic plaque psoriasis is the most common type of psoriasis, and it is characterised by redness, thickness, and scaling. First‐line management of chronic plaque psoriasis is with topical treatments, including vitamin D analogues, topical corticosteroids, tar‐based preparations, dithranol, salicylic acid, and topical retinoids. Objectives To compare the effectiveness, tolerability, and safety of topical treatments for chronic plaque psoriasis, relative to placebo, and to similarly compare vitamin D analogues (used alone or in combination) with other topical treatments. Search methods We updated our searches of the following databases to February 2011: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL in  The Cochrane Library  (2011, Issue 2), MEDLINE (from 1948), EMBASE (from 1980), Science Citation Index (from 2008), Conference Proceedings Citation Index ‐ Science (from 2008), BIOSIS (from 1993), Dissertation Abstracts via DialogClassic (all publication years), and Inside Conferences (all publication years). We identified ongoing and unpublished studies from the UK Clinical Research Network Study Portfolio and the  meta Register of Controlled Trials. We checked the bibliographies of published studies and reviews for further references to relevant trials, and we contacted trialists and companies for information about newly published studies. A separate search for adverse effects was undertaken in February 2011 using MEDLINE and EMBASE (from 2005). Final update searches for both RCTs and adverse effects were undertaken in August 2012. Although it has not been possible to incorporate RCTs and adverse effects studies identified through these final searches within this review, we will incorporate these into the next update. Selection criteria Randomised trials comparing active topical treatments against placebo or against vitamin D analogues (used alone or in combination) in people with chronic plaque psoriasis. Data collection and analysis One author extracted study data and assessed study quality. A second author checked these data. We routinely contacted trialists and companies for missing data. We also extracted data on withdrawals and on local and systemic adverse events. We defined long‐term trials as those with a duration of at least 24 weeks. Main results This update added 48 trials and provided evidence on 7 new active treatments. In total, the review included 177 randomised controlled trials, with 34,808 participants, including 26 trials of scalp psoriasis and 6 trials of inverse psoriasis, facial psoriasis, or both. The number of included studies counted by Review Manager (RevMan) is higher than these figures (190) because we entered each study reporting a placebo and an active comparison into the 'Characteristics of included studies' table as 2 studies. When used on the body, most vitamin D analogues were significantly more effective than placebo, with the standardised mean difference (SMD) ranging from ‐0.67 (95% CI ‐1.04 to ‐0.30; 1 study, 119 participants) for twice‐daily becocalcidiol to SMD ‐1.66 (95% CI ‐2.66 to ‐0.67; 1 study, 11 participants) for once‐daily paricalcitol. On a 6‐point global improvement scale, these effects translate into 0.8 and 1.9 points, respectively. Most corticosteroids also performed better than placebo; potent corticosteroids (SMD ‐0.89; 95% CI ‐1.06 to ‐0.72; I² statistic = 65.1%; 14 studies, 2011 participants) had smaller benefits than very potent corticosteroids (SMD ‐1.56; 95% CI ‐1.87 to ‐1.26); I² statistic = 81.7%; 10 studies, 1264 participants). On a 6‐point improvement scale, these benefits equate to 1.0 and 1.8 points, respectively. Dithranol, combined treatment with vitamin D/corticosteroid, and tazarotene all performed significantly better than placebo. Head‐to‐head comparisons of vitamin D for psoriasis of the body against potent or very potent corticosteroids had mixed findings. For both body and scalp psoriasis, combined treatment with vitamin D and corticosteroid performed significantly better than vitamin D alone or corticosteroid alone. Vitamin D generally performed better than coal tar, but findings relative to dithranol were mixed. When applied to psoriasis of the scalp, vitamin D was significantly less effective than both potent corticosteroids and very potent corticosteroids. Indirect evidence from placebo‐controlled trials supported these findings. For both body and scalp psoriasis, potent corticosteroids were less likely than vitamin D to cause local adverse events, such as burning or irritation. Combined treatment with vitamin D/corticosteroid on either the body or the scalp was tolerated as well as potent corticosteroids, and significantly better than vitamin D alone. Only 25 trials assessed clinical cutaneous dermal atrophy; few cases were detected, but trials reported insufficient information to determine whether assessment methods were robust. Clinical measurements of dermal atrophy are insensitive and detect only the most severe cases. No comparison of topical agents found a significant difference in systemic adverse effects. Authors' conclusions Corticosteroids perform at least as well as vitamin D analogues, and they are associated with a lower incidence of local adverse events. However, for people with chronic plaque psoriasis receiving long‐term treatment with corticosteroids, there remains a lack of evidence about the risk of skin dermal atrophy. Further research is required to inform long‐term maintenance treatment and provide appropriate safety data. Plain language summary Skin treatments for chronic plaque psoriasis Chronic plaque psoriasis is the most common type of psoriasis. Although any part of the body may be affected, the most commonly affected sites are the elbows, knees, and scalp. 'Topical' treatments (i.e. treatments applied to the skin) are usually tried first. These include vitamin D products, topical corticosteroids, tar‐based preparations, dithranol, salicylic acid, and vitamin A products. As chronic plaque psoriasis is a long‐term condition, it is important to find out which treatments work best and what adverse effects they have. This review describes average benefits of different treatments, while recognising that individuals will vary in their experience of each treatment. The evidence was based on 177 studies, which, in total, included 34,808 people. Studies were typically about 7 weeks' long, but this ranged from 1 week to 52 weeks. Vitamin D products were found to work better than placebo (the base cream or ointment). Potent topical corticosteroids (strong, e.g. betamethasone dipropionate) and very potent (very strong, e.g. clobetasol propionate) topical corticosteroids were also effective. Some studies compared vitamin D products directly with potent or very potent corticosteroids. These products had similar effects when applied to the body, but corticosteroids worked better than vitamin D for scalp psoriasis. Treatment that combined vitamin D with a corticosteroid was more effective than vitamin D alone and more effective than the topical corticosteroid alone. Vitamin D products generally performed better than coal tar, but studies found conflicting results when comparing vitamin D with dithranol. Whether applied to the body or to the scalp, potent corticosteroids were less likely than vitamin D to cause 'local adverse events', such as skin irritation or burning, and people were therefore more likely to stop using vitamin D products. When studies examined whether topical treatments had effects within the body ('systemic adverse events'), we found no difference between placebo and any other treatment. However, this may be because many trials did not properly assess systemic adverse events, rather than because there really was no difference. More long‐term studies would help doctors and people with psoriasis decide on the best way to treat this chronic condition.

AB  -  Abstract - Background This is the second update of this Cochrane Review. Some studies have suggested a protective effect of antioxidant nutrients and higher dietary levels of fruits and vegetables on lung cancer. Objectives To determine whether vitamins and minerals and other potential agents, alone or in combination, reduce lung cancer incidence and lung cancer mortality in healthy populations. Search methods We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE and Embase from 1974 to May 2019 and screened references included in published studies and reviews. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing vitamins or mineral supplements with placebo, administered to healthy people with the aim of preventing lung cancer. Data collection and analysis Four review authors independently selected the trials to be included in the review, assessed their methodological quality and extracted data. For dichotomous outcomes we calculated risk ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and pooled results using the random‐effects model. We assessed the risk of bias using Cochrane's 'Risk of bias' assessment tool and certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach. Main results In this update, we identified three new trials for a total of 12 studies. Six analysed vitamin A, three vitamin C, three combined vitamin D3 + calcium, four vitamin E combined with other products, one selenium supplements and nine studied combinations of two or more products. Four studies included only men and five only women. Vitamin A results in little to no difference in lung cancer incidence (RR 1.09, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.19; 5 RCTs, 212314 participants; high‐certainty evidence) and lung cancer mortality (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.38; 3 RCTs, 190118 participants; high‐certainty evidence). But in smokers or asbestos workers vitamin A increases the risk of lung cancer incidence (RR 1.10, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.20; 3 RCTs, 43995 participants; high‐certainty evidence), lung cancer mortality (RR 1.18, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.38; 2 RCTs, 29426 participants; high‐certainty evidence) and all‐cause mortality (RR 1.09, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.13; 2 RCTs, 32883 participants; high‐certainty evidence). Vitamin A increases the risk of minor side effects, such as yellowing of the skin and minor gastrointestinal symptoms (high‐certainty evidence). Vitamin C likely results in little to no difference in lung cancer incidence (RR 1.29, 95% CI 0.67 to 2.49; 2 RCTs, 14953 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). In women, vitamin C increases the risk of lung cancer incidence (RR 1.84, 95% CI 1.14 to 2.95; 1 RCT, 7627 participants; high‐certainty evidence). In men, vitamin C results in little to no difference in mortality for lung cancer (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.23; 1 RCT, 7326 participants; high‐certainty evidence). Vitamin D + calcium may result in little to no difference in lung cancer incidence in postmenopausal women (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.39 to 2.08; 3 RCTs, 37601 women; low‐certainty evidence). Vitamin E results in little to no difference in lung cancer incidence (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.14; 3 RCTs, 36841 participants; high‐certainty evidence) or to lung cancer mortality (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.18; 2 RCTs, 29214 participants; high‐certainty evidence), but increases the risk of haemorrhagic strokes (hazard ratio (HR), 1.74, 95% CI 1.04 to 2.91; 1 RCT, 14641 participants; high‐certainty evidence). Calcium results in little to no difference in lung cancer incidence in postmenopausal women (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.13 to 3.18; 1 RCT, 733 participants) or in risk of renal calculi (RR 1.94, 95% CI 0.20 to 18.57; 1 RCT, 733 participants; low‐certainty evidence). Selenium in men results in little to no difference in lung cancer incidence (RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.54; 1 RCT, 17448 participants; high‐certainty evidence) and lung cancer mortality (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.66; 1 RCT, 17448 participants; high‐certainty evidence) and increases the risk for grade 1 to 2 dermatitis (RR 1.16, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.31; 1 RCT, 17448 participants; high‐certainty evidence) and for alopecia (RR 1.28, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.53; 1 RCT, 17448 participants; high‐certainty evidence). The combination of vitamins A, C, E + selenium + zinc results in little to no difference in lung cancer incidence (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.28 to 1.48; 1 RCT, 12741 participants; high‐certainty evidence). Authors' conclusions Well‐designed RCTs have shown no beneficial effect of supplements for the prevention of lung cancer and lung cancer mortality in healthy people. Vitamin A supplements increase lung cancer incidence and mortality in smokers or persons exposed to asbestos. Vitamin C increases lung cancer incidence in women. Vitamin E increases the risk of haemorrhagic strokes. Plain language summary Drugs for preventing lung cancer in healthy people Review question We reviewed the evidence assessing the relationship between vitamins or antioxidant intake and lung cancer prevention, mortality and adverse events for that cancer. This review updates our Cochrane Review on this topic published in 2012. Background Lung cancer is among the leading causes of cancer death throughout the world, and its prevention has become a public health priority. It has been suggested that vitamin supplements and some antioxidants may prevent lung cancer. Study characteristics This review includes 12 studies in which healthy adults were randomly assigned to receive vitamin supplements or placebo (a substance that has no physical effects) and were followed over time to evaluate their risk of developing lung cancer. The evidence is current to May 2019. Key results None of the treatments compared with placebo have shown a difference in the risk for lung cancer incidence or lung cancer mortality in healthy people. In smokers and people exposed to asbestos, vitamin A increases lung cancer incidence, lung cancer mortality and all‐cause mortality. Vitamin C increases lung cancer incidence in women. Vitamin E increases the risk of haemorrhagic strokes. The certainty of the evidence is high for the following comparisons against placebo: vitamin A; vitamin E; selenium; and combinations of vitamins A, C, E, selenium and zinc.

AB  -  Abstract - Background Lung edema may complicate respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) in preterm infants. Objectives The aim of this review was to assess the risks and benefits of diuretic administration in preterm infants with RDS. Search methods The standard search method of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group was used. The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL,  The Cochrane Library ), MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched. These searches were updated in April 2003, March 2007, January 2011. In addition, the abstract books of the American Thoracic Society and Society for Pediatric Research were searched. MEDLINE and CENTRAL search was conducted using the keyword "Respiratory Distress Syndrome" alone, to find studies of medications recently classified as diuretics, such as theophylline. In addition, EMBASE, controlled‐trials.com and clinicaltrials.gov searches were completed in January 2011. MEDLINE search updated to August 2011. Selection criteria Trials were included in which preterm infants with RDS and less than five days of age were randomly allocated to diuretic administration. Of those trials, studies were only included in which at least one of the following outcomes measures was evaluated: mortality, patent ductus arteriosus, hypovolemic shock, intraventricular hemorrhage, renal failure, duration of oxygen supplementation, duration of mechanical ventilation, need for oxygen supplementation at 28 days of life, oxygen supplementation at 36 weeks of postmenstrual age (gestational age + postnatal age), length of stay, number of rehospitalizations during the first year of life, and neurodevelopmental outcome. Data collection and analysis The standard method for the Cochrane Collaboration, which is described in the Cochrane Collaboration Handbook, was used. Two investigators extracted, assessed and coded separately all data for each study. Any disagreement was resolved by discussion. Main results Seven studies met inclusion criteria. Six studies using furosemide were done before the current era of prenatal steroids, surfactant and fluid restriction. Furosemide administration had no long‐term benefits. Furosemide‐induced transient improvement in pulmonary function did not outweigh an increased risk for patent ductus arteriosus and for hemodynamic instability. In one recent study, theophylline had no long‐term benefits. Theophylline significantly decreased the risk of oligoanuria and transiently increased renal function, but did not significantly affect renal function at discharge or other outcomes. Authors' conclusions There are no data to support routine administration of furosemide in preterm infants with RDS. Elective administration of furosemide to any patient with RDS should be carefully weighed against the risk of precipitating hypovolemia or developing a symptomatic patent ductus arteriosus. There are not enough data to support routine administration of low‐dose theophylline in preterm infants with RDS. Plain language summary Diuretics for respiratory distress syndrome in preterm infants There is not enough data to support the routine use of diuretics for respiratory distress syndrome in newborn babies. Diuretics are drugs that increase the production of urine by encouraging salt and water to be released from the kidneys. When newborn babies have respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), their lungs may also contain excess fluid that can cause breathing problems. Babies with RDS sometimes may also have a reduced urine output. Using diuretics in these babies may improve lung or kidney function transiently, but may also increase cardiovascular complications. The review of trials did not find enough evidence supporting the routine use of diuretics in these infants.

AB  -  Abstract - Background Uptake of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine remains low in many countries, although the bivalent and quadrivalent HPV vaccines given as a three‐dose schedule are effective in the prevention of precancerous lesions of the cervix in women. Simpler immunisation schedules, such as those with fewer doses, might reduce barriers to vaccination, as may programmes that include males. Objectives To evaluate the efficacy, immunogenicity, and harms of different dose schedules and different types of HPV vaccines in females and males. Search methods We conducted electronic searches on 27 September 2018 in Ovid MEDLINE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (in the Cochrane Library), and Ovid Embase. We also searched the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and ClinicalTrials.gov (both 27 September 2018), vaccine manufacturer websites, and checked reference lists from an index of HPV studies and other relevant systematic reviews. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with no language restriction. We considered studies if they enrolled HIV‐negative males or females aged 9 to 26 years, or HIV‐positive males or females of any age. Data collection and analysis We used methods recommended by Cochrane. We use the term 'control' to refer to comparator products containing an adjuvant or active vaccine and 'placebo' to refer to products that contain no adjuvant or active vaccine. Most primary outcomes in this review were clinical outcomes. However, for comparisons comparing dose schedules, the included RCTs were designed to measure antibody responses (i.e. immunogenicity) as the primary outcome, rather than clinical outcomes, since it is unethical to collect cervical samples from girls under 16 years of age. We analysed immunogenicity outcomes (i.e. geometric mean titres) with ratios of means, clinical outcomes (e.g. cancer and intraepithelial neoplasia) with risk ratios or rate ratios and, for serious adverse events and deaths, we calculated odds ratios. We rated the certainty of evidence with GRADE. Main results We included 20 RCTs with 31,940 participants. The length of follow‐up in the included studies ranged from seven months to five years. Two doses versus three doses of HPV vaccine in 9‐ to 15‐year‐old females Antibody responses after two‐dose and three‐dose HPV vaccine schedules were similar after up to five years of follow‐up (4 RCTs, moderate‐ to high‐certainty evidence). No RCTs collected clinical outcome data. Evidence about serious adverse events in studies comparing dose schedules was of very low‐certainty owing to imprecision and indirectness (three doses 35/1159; two doses 36/1158; 4 RCTs). One death was reported in the three‐dose group (1/898) and none in the two‐dose group (0/899) (low‐certainty evidence). Interval between doses of HPV vaccine in 9‐ to 14‐year‐old females and males Antibody responses were stronger with a longer interval (6 or 12 months) between the first two doses of HPV vaccine than a shorter interval (2 or 6 months) at up to three years of follow‐up (4 RCTs, moderate‐ to high‐certainty evidence). No RCTs collected data about clinical outcomes. Evidence about serious adverse events in studies comparing intervals was of very low‐certainty, owing to imprecision and indirectness. No deaths were reported in any of the studies (0/1898, 3 RCTs, low‐certainty evidence). HPV vaccination of 10‐ to 26‐year‐old males In one RCT there was moderate‐certainty evidence that quadrivalent HPV vaccine, compared with control, reduced the incidence of external genital lesions (control 36 per 3081 person‐years; quadrivalent 6 per 3173 person‐years; rate ratio 0.16, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.38; 6254 person‐years) and anogenital warts (control 28 per 2814 person‐years; quadrivalent 3 per 2831 person‐years; rate ratio 0.11, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.38; 5645 person‐years). The quadrivalent vaccine resulted in more injection‐site adverse events, such as pain or redness, than control (537 versus 601 per 1000; risk ratio (RR) 1.12, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.18, 3895 participants, high‐certainty evidence). There was very low‐certainty evidence from two RCTs about serious adverse events with quadrivalent vaccine (control 12/2588; quadrivalent 8/2574), and about deaths (control 11/2591; quadrivalent 3/2582), owing to imprecision and indirectness. Nonavalent versus quadrivalent vaccine in 9‐ to 26‐year‐old females and males Three RCTs were included; one in females aged 9‐ to 15‐years (n = 600), one in females aged 16‐ to 26‐years (n = 14,215), and one in males aged 16‐ to 26‐years (n = 500). The RCT in 16‐ to 26‐year‐old females reported clinical outcomes. There was little to no difference in the incidence of the combined outcome of high‐grade cervical epithelial neoplasia, adenocarcinoma in situ, or cervical cancer between the HPV vaccines (quadrivalent 325/6882, nonavalent 326/6871; OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.16; 13,753 participants; high‐certainty evidence). The other two RCTs did not collect data about clinical outcomes. There were slightly more local adverse events with the nonavalent vaccine (905 per 1000) than the quadrivalent vaccine (846 per 1000) (RR 1.07, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.08; 3 RCTs, 15,863 participants; high‐certainty evidence). Comparative evidence about serious adverse events in the three RCTs (nonavalent 243/8234, quadrivalent 192/7629; OR 0.60, 95% CI 0.14 to 2.61) was of low certainty, owing to imprecision and indirectness. HPV vaccination for people living with HIV Seven RCTs reported on HPV vaccines in people with HIV, with two small trials that collected data about clinical outcomes. Antibody responses were higher following vaccination with either bivalent or quadrivalent HPV vaccine than with control, and these responses could be demonstrated to have been maintained for up to 24 months in children living with HIV (low‐certainty evidence). The evidence about clinical outcomes and harms for HPV vaccines in people with HIV is very uncertain (low‐ to very low‐certainty evidence), owing to imprecision and indirectness. Authors' conclusions The immunogenicity of two‐dose and three‐dose HPV vaccine schedules, measured using antibody responses in young females, is comparable. The quadrivalent vaccine probably reduces external genital lesions and anogenital warts in males compared with control. The nonavalent and quadrivalent vaccines offer similar protection against a combined outcome of cervical, vaginal, and vulval precancer lesions or cancer. In people living with HIV, both the bivalent and quadrivalent HPV vaccines result in high antibody responses. For all comparisons of alternative HPV vaccine schedules, the certainty of the body of evidence about serious adverse events reported during the study periods was low or very low, either because the number of events was low, or the evidence was indirect, or both. Post‐marketing surveillance is needed to continue monitoring harms that might be associated with HPV vaccines in the population, and this evidence will be incorporated in future updates of this review. Long‐term observational studies are needed to determine the effectiveness of reduced‐dose schedules against HPV‐related cancer endpoints, and whether adopting these schedules improves vaccine coverage rates. Plain language summary Comparison of different human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines and the number of doses administered to prevent HPV‐related disease in females and males Human papillomaviruses (HPV) are a group of viruses that infect the skin and mucous membranes. Some types of HPV are sexually transmitted and are common in young people. Most infections will be cleared by the immune system, but some people will experience persistent infection with certain HPV types that go on to cause abnormalities in infected cells. These changes are called 'precancerous' because they can develop into cancers of the cervix, vagina, vulva, anal canal, penis, and head and neck. Infection with other HPV types causes warts in the genital area or around the anus. Vaccination aims to prevent future HPV infections. Three HPV vaccines are in use – a bivalent one (protects against two HPV types), a quadrivalent one (protects against four HPV types), and a nonavalent one (protects against nine HPV types). In women, three doses of the bivalent or the quadrivalent HPV vaccines protect against precancer of the cervix caused by the HPV types contained in the vaccine. Evidence about the nonavalent vaccine, about the effects of the quadrivalent vaccine in males, and about the effects of HPV vaccines in people with HIV infection, has not yet been reviewed thoroughly. Uptake of HPV vaccines remains low in many countries. Simpler vaccine schedules, or giving the vaccine to both girls and boys, could increase the number of people being vaccinated. Trials of HPV vaccines are not always designed to collect data about precancer and cancer, for several reasons. Firstly, HPV vaccine is routinely given before girls become sexually active, and it is not ethical to take specimens from the cervix of girls who have not had sex. Secondly, HPV‐related precancer and cancer are rare and do not develop until years after HPV infection has occurred. Thirdly, participants in a trial will be offered treatment if precancer develops, so progression to cervical cancer would be even rarer, even without vaccination. An international committee of experts states that, in some circumstances, antibody levels (i.e. showing a strong immune system response), can be used to demonstrate protection against cervical and anal cancer. The antibody levels following vaccination in a trial should not be lower than those found in other studies on adults in whom the vaccine has been shown to protect against severe HPV‐related cervical or anal disease. Review question(s) How effective or harmful are different HPV vaccine schedules (i.e. number and timing of doses) and different HPV vaccines in females and males? Main results These results are based on research evidence to 27 September 2018. We analysed 20 studies involving 31,940 people. Studies comparing two doses of HPV vaccine to three doses, or comparing the time interval between doses, focus on immune system responses rather than infection or disease outcomes. Two doses of HPV vaccine result in similar immune system responses to three doses, and a longer interval (up to 12 months) between doses gives a stronger immune system response than a shorter interval. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether there was a difference between the vaccine schedules for serious adverse events and death. In 16‐ to 26‐year‐old men, one study showed evidence of moderate certainty that a quadrivalent HPV vaccine provides better protection against external genital lesions and genital warts than a dummy treatment (control). In 16‐ to 26‐year‐old women, one study showed that the nonavalent and quadrivalent vaccines provide the same levels of protection against cervical, vaginal, and vulval precancer lesions and cancer (high‐certainty evidence). There was evidence that the quadrivalent vaccine resulted in more local adverse events (such as pain, swelling, and redness at the injection site) than a control treatment in males, and that the nonavalent vaccine resulted in more local adverse events than the quadrivalent vaccine in males and females. Evidence about serious adverse events and deaths from studies comparing different HPV vaccine types or dose schedules was of low or very low‐certainty. In people living with HIV, HPV vaccines result in reasonable levels of immune system response, but evidence about their effects on persistent HPV infection or HPV‐related disease outcomes and harms is limited. Certainty of the evidence No major issues were identified with the methodological quality of the studies for the measurements of infection and disease outcomes, or for immune system responses. Our certainty in the evidence about serious harms and deaths across all the studies comparing different HPV vaccines and vaccine schedules is low, either because of their low frequency, or because the evidence is indirect, or both. Evidence graded as high certainty means that we were confident that further research is unlikely to change our findings. Moderate‐certainty evidence means that there is a possibility that further research may have an important effect on our findings, whilst low‐certainty evidence means that our confidence was limited and further research may have an important impact on our findings. Very low‐certainty evidence means that we were uncertain about the result. Conclusion A two‐dose schedule of HPV vaccines in young females results in immune system responses that are comparable with a three‐dose schedule. In males, the quadrivalent HPV vaccine appears to be effective in the prevention of external genital lesions and genital warts. Quadrivalent and nonavalent HPV vaccines in young women result in similar levels of protection against cervical, vaginal, and vulval precancer lesions and cancer. Evidence about the efficacy and harms in people living with HIV is limited. Further long‐term population‐level studies are needed to continue monitoring safety of these vaccines, to determine for how long two doses of vaccine can provide protection against HPV‐related disease, the effect against HPV‐related cancer, and whether a two‐dose immunisation schedule will increase vaccine coverage.

AB  -  Abstract - Background Omega‐3 polyunsaturated fatty acids from oily fish (long‐chain omega‐3 (LCn3)), including eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)), as well as from plants (alpha‐linolenic acid (ALA)) may benefit cardiovascular health. Guidelines recommend increasing omega‐3‐rich foods, and sometimes supplementation, but recent trials have not confirmed this. Objectives To assess the effects of increased intake of fish‐ and plant‐based omega‐3 fats for all‐cause mortality, cardiovascular events, adiposity and lipids. Search methods We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE and Embase to February 2019, plus ClinicalTrials.gov and World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry to August 2019, with no language restrictions. We handsearched systematic review references and bibliographies and contacted trial authors. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that lasted at least 12 months and compared supplementation or advice to increase LCn3 or ALA intake, or both, versus usual or lower intake. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion, extracted data and assessed validity. We performed separate random‐effects meta‐analysis for ALA and LCn3 interventions, and assessed dose‐response relationships through meta‐regression. Main results We included 86 RCTs (162,796 participants) in this review update and found that 28 were at low summary risk of bias. Trials were of 12 to 88 months' duration and included adults at varying cardiovascular risk, mainly in high‐income countries. Most trials assessed LCn3 supplementation with capsules, but some used LCn3‐ or ALA‐rich or enriched foods or dietary advice compared to placebo or usual diet. LCn3 doses ranged from 0.5 g a day to more than 5 g a day (19 RCTs gave at least 3 g LCn3 daily). Meta‐analysis and sensitivity analyses suggested  little or no effect of increasing LCn3  on  all‐cause mortality  (risk ratio (RR) 0.97, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.93 to 1.01; 143,693 participants; 11,297 deaths in 45 RCTs; high‐certainty evidence),  cardiovascular mortality  (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.86 to 0.99; 117,837 participants; 5658 deaths in 29 RCTs; moderate‐certainty evidence),  cardiovascular events  (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.01; 140,482 participants; 17,619 people experienced events in 43 RCTs; high‐certainty evidence),  stroke  (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.12; 138,888 participants; 2850 strokes in 31 RCTs; moderate‐certainty evidence) or  arrhythmia  (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.06; 77,990 participants; 4586 people experienced arrhythmia in 30 RCTs; low‐certainty evidence). Increasing LCn3 may  slightly reduce coronary heart disease mortality (number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 334 , RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.00; 127,378 participants; 3598 coronary heart disease deaths in 24 RCTs, low‐certainty evidence) and  coronary heart disease events  ( NNTB 167 , RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.85 to 0.97; 134,116 participants; 8791 people experienced coronary heart disease events in 32 RCTs, low‐certainty evidence). Overall, effects did not differ by trial duration or LCn3 dose in pre‐planned subgrouping or meta‐regression. There is little evidence of effects of eating fish. Increasing ALA  intake probably makes  little or no difference to all‐cause mortality  (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.20; 19,327 participants; 459 deaths in 5 RCTs, moderate‐certainty evidence), cardiovascular mortality  (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.25; 18,619 participants; 219 cardiovascular deaths in 4 RCTs; moderate‐certainty evidence),  coronary heart disease mortality  (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.26; 18,353 participants; 193 coronary heart disease deaths in 3 RCTs; moderate‐certainty evidence) and  coronary heart disease events  (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.22; 19,061 participants; 397 coronary heart disease events in 4 RCTs; low‐certainty evidence). However, increased ALA may slightly  reduce risk of cardiovascular disease events  ( NNTB 500 , RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.07; but RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.04 in RCTs at low summary risk of bias; 19,327 participants; 884 cardiovascular disease events in 5 RCTs; low‐certainty evidence), and probably slightly reduces risk of  arrhythmia  ( NNTB 91 , RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.97; 4912 participants; 173 events in 2 RCTs; moderate‐certainty evidence). Effects on  stroke are unclear . Increasing LCn3 and ALA had little or no effect on serious adverse events, adiposity, lipids and blood pressure, except increasing LCn3 reduced triglycerides by ˜15% in a dose‐dependent way (high‐certainty evidence). Authors' conclusions This is the most extensive systematic assessment of effects of omega‐3 fats on cardiovascular health to date. Moderate‐ and low‐certainty evidence suggests that increasing LCn3 slightly reduces risk of coronary heart disease mortality and events, and reduces serum triglycerides (evidence mainly from supplement trials). Increasing ALA slightly reduces risk of cardiovascular events and arrhythmia. Plain language summary Omega‐3 intake for cardiovascular disease Review question We reviewed randomised trials (where participants have an equal chance of being assigned to either treatment) examining effects of increasing fish‐ and plant‐based omega‐3 fats on heart and circulatory disease (called cardiovascular diseases, which include heart attacks and stroke), fatness and blood fats (lipids, including cholesterol, triglycerides, high‐density lipoprotein (HDL – 'good' cholesterol) and low‐density lipoprotein (LDL – 'bad' cholesterol)). Background The main types of omega‐3 fats are eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), both found in fish, and alpha‐linolenic acid (ALA) found in plant foods. Many people believe that taking omega‐3 supplements reduces risk of heart disease, stroke and death. Trial characteristics The evidence is current to February 2019. The review included 86 trials involving 162,796 people. These trials assessed effects of greater omega‐3 intake versus lower omega‐3 intake for at least a year on heart and circulatory disease. Twenty‐eight trials were very trustworthy (well‐designed so as not to give biased results). Participants were adults, some with existing illness and some healthy, living in North America, Europe, Australia and Asia. Most EPA and DHA trials provided capsules, few gave oily fish. Key results Increasing EPA and DHA has little or no effect on deaths and cardiovascular events (high‐certainty evidence) and probably makes little or no difference to cardiovascular death, stroke, or heart irregularities (moderate‐certainty evidence). However, increasing EPA and DHA may slightly reduce risk of coronary death and coronary events (low‐certainty evidence, coronary events are illnesses of arteries supplying the heart). To prevent one person having a coronary event, 167 people would need to increase their EPA and DHA, and 334 people would need to increase their EPA and DHA to prevent one person dying from coronary disease. EPA and DHA reduce triglycerides by about 15% but do not affect fatness or other lipids (high‐certainty evidence). Eating more ALA (for example, by increasing walnuts or enriched margarine) probably makes little or no difference to all‐cause, cardiovascular or coronary deaths or coronary events but probably slightly reduces cardiovascular events and heart irregularities (moderate‐ or low‐certainty evidence). To prevent one person having a coronary event, 500 people would need to increase their ALA, 91 people to prevent one person having arrhythmia. There is little evidence of effects of eating fish. EPA and DHA reduce triglycerides. EPA, DHA and ALA may be slightly protective of some heart and circulatory diseases.

AB  -  Abstract - Rationale Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy are a leading cause of maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality. Calcium supplementation commenced before pregnancy may prevent the development of these disorders. This is an update of a review last published in 2019. Objectives To assess the effects of calcium supplementation commenced before pregnancy on hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and related maternal and neonatal outcomes. Search methods We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Portal Regional BVS‐Lilacs, Scopus, Web of Science, WHO ICTRP and ClinicalTrials.gov on 7 January 2025 and searched reference lists of retrieved trials and relevant systematic reviews. Eligibility criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared calcium supplementation commenced before pregnancy with placebo or standard care. Trials conducted after 2010 needed to be prospectively registered. We applied a trustworthiness checklist. Outcomes Critical outcomes for women were pre‐eclampsia or pregnancy loss, and pre‐eclampsia. The critical outcome for children was perinatal loss. Our main important outcomes for women were pregnancy loss at any gestational age, maternal death, maternal death or severe morbidity, and adverse effects. Our main important outcomes for children were preterm delivery before 37 weeks, neonatal death or severe morbidity, stillbirth, neonatal death, and early neonatal death. Risk of bias We used version 2 of the Cochrane tool for assessing risk of bias in randomised trials (RoB 2). Synthesis methods Two review authors independently selected trials, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias and trustworthiness. We pooled data using random‐effects meta‐analysis. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE. Because conception and pregnancy loss are intermediate outcomes potentially on the causal pathway to pre‐eclampsia, we chose the composite outcome 'pre‐eclampsia or pregnancy loss' as the first critical outcome (and most relevant to pregnant women), and included sensitivity analyses including only women who conceived during the trial. Included studies We included one multicentre, double‐blind, randomised, placebo‐controlled trial. It included 1355 parous women, whose most recent planned pregnancy had been complicated by pre‐eclampsia or eclampsia. Synthesis of results Pre‐eclampsia or pregnancy loss at any gestational age Compared to placebo, calcium may result in little to no difference in pre‐eclampsia or pregnancy loss at any gestational age (risk ratio (RR) 0.85, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.67 to 1.07; 1 RCT, 1355 women; risk difference (RD) 28/1000 fewer, 95% CI 61 fewer to 13 more; low‐certainty evidence). Sensitivity analysis including only women who conceived during the trial yielded a risk ratio of 0.82 (95% CI 0.66 to 1.00; 1 RCT, 633 women). Pre‐eclampsia Compared to placebo, calcium may result in little to no difference in pre‐eclampsia (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.14; 1 RCT, 1355 women; RD 19/1000 fewer, 95% CI 46 fewer to 17 more; low‐certainty evidence). Sensitivity analysis including only women who conceived during the trial yielded a risk ratio of 0.81 (95% CI 0.61 to 1.07; 1 RCT, 633 women). Pregnancy loss at any gestational age Compared to placebo, calcium may result in little to no difference in pregnancy loss at any gestational age (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.24; 1 RCT, 1355 women; RD 9/1000 fewer, 95% CI 37 fewer to 28 more; low‐certainty evidence). Sensitivity analysis including only women who conceived during the trial yielded a risk ratio of 0.89 (95% CI 0.67 to 1.17; 1 RCT, 633 women). Maternal death The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of calcium compared to placebo on maternal death (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.14 to 7.07; 1 RCT, 1355 women; RD 0/10,000 fewer, 95% CI 25 fewer to 179 more; very low‐certainty evidence). Sensitivity analysis including only women who conceived during the trial yielded a risk ratio of 0.96 (95% CI 0.14 to 6.77; 1 RCT, 633 women). Maternal death or severe morbidity The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of calcium, compared to placebo, on maternal death or severe morbidity (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.35; 1 RCT, 1355 women; RD 3/1000 fewer, 95% CI 29 fewer to 34 more; very low‐certainty evidence). Sensitivity analysis including only women who conceived during the trial yielded a risk ratio of 0.93 (95% CI 0.68 to 1.27; 1 RCT, 633 women). Preterm delivery before 37 weeks Compared to placebo, calcium may result in little to no difference in preterm delivery before 37 weeks (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.19; 1 RCT, 1355 women; RD 11/1000 fewer, 95% CI 46 fewer to 33 more; low‐certainty evidence). Sensitivity analysis including only women who conceived during the trial yielded a risk ratio of 0.90 (95% CI 0.74 to 1.11; 1 RCT, 633 women). Stillbirth The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of calcium compared to placebo on stillbirth (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.34; 1 RCT, 1355 women; RD 9/1000 fewer, 95% CI 24 fewer to 17 more; very low‐certainty evidence). Sensitivity analysis including only women who conceived during the trial yielded a risk ratio of 0.79 (95% CI 0.48 to 1.27; 1 RCT, 633 women). The included trial did not measure perinatal loss, maternal adverse effects, neonatal death or severe morbidity, neonatal death, or early neonatal death. Authors' conclusions When all randomised women are considered, calcium commenced before pregnancy may result in little to no difference in pre‐eclampsia or pregnancy loss, and pre‐eclampsia. When only pregnant women are considered, calcium may result in little to no difference in pre‐eclampsia but may result in a slight reduction in pre‐eclampsia or pregnancy loss. No trials measured perinatal loss. The evidence is drawn from one trial of calcium supplementation that commenced before and continued into the first half of pregnancy. Current evidence neither supports nor refutes the routine use of calcium supplementation commencing before conception. Funding This review was funded in part by the World Health Organization. Registration Updated protocol (2025): PROSPERO: CRD420250649571 Review update (2019): DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD011192.pub3 Original review (2017): DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD011192.pub2 Plain language summary Do calcium supplements started before pregnancy help to prevent high blood pressure and its complications? Key messages Evidence from one study (1355 women) shows that extra calcium before pregnancy may result in little to no difference to pre‐eclampsia (a complication of pregnancy) or pregnancy loss, and pre‐eclampsia. Evidence from 633 women who got pregnant during the study showed similar results except for a slight reduction in pre‐eclampsia or pregnancy loss. The study did not provide evidence for unwanted effects of calcium or death of the baby during pregnancy and early life. We need more research to decide whether calcium supplements started before pregnancy help women avoid high blood pressure, pre‐eclampsia and other complications. Research should also address how acceptable women find calcium supplements. Why is high blood pressure a problem in pregnancy, and how could calcium help? High blood pressure in pregnancy is a leading cause of death and severe illness in mothers and babies. Pre‐eclampsia is the most serious complication. It is diagnosed when the pregnant woman develops high blood pressure with signs of damage to the placenta and other organs such as the kidneys or liver. There is currently no treatment for pre‐eclampsia apart from delivering the baby. Calcium may help to lower blood pressure. Many people, especially in low‐income countries, have insufficient calcium in their diets, so giving calcium supplements before pregnancy may prevent pre‐eclampsia and could save many mothers and babies. What did we want to find out? We wanted to know if giving calcium supplements to women before they get pregnant could help prevent high blood pressure, pre‐eclampsia and other serious health problems for the mother and baby. We were also interested in any unwanted effects of calcium supplements. What did we do? We searched for studies that compared giving calcium supplements before pregnancy with placebo (a dummy medicine) or normal care. Women in the studies had to be planning a pregnancy. They could be any age and live anywhere in the world. Their normal diets could include any amount of calcium, and they could be at any risk of high blood pressure. Studies could give any dose of calcium for any length of time, as long as supplements started before pregnancy. We looked at the evidence for all the women in the study, and only for women who became pregnant during the study. We compared and summarised the studies' results, and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. What did we find? We found one study with 1355 women. They had all had pre‐eclampsia in their most recent pregnancy, so were at high risk of getting it again. They were given extra calcium or a placebo tablet daily until 20 weeks of pregnancy. After 20 weeks, all women were switched to extra daily calcium until they gave birth. They lived in Argentina, South Africa, and Zimbabwe. Calcium supplements before pregnancy may make little to no difference to: pre‐eclampsia or pregnancy loss; pre‐eclampsia; pregnancy loss; and delivery of the baby before 37 weeks. We are not sure about the effect of extra calcium before pregnancy on death of the mother, death or severe illness of the mother and stillbirth. The results for 633 women who got pregnant during the study are very similar, except that there may be a slight reduction in pre‐eclampsia or pregnancy loss. There was no evidence about unwanted effects, death of the baby during pregnancy and early life, death of the newborn baby, death of newborns in the first 7 days of life, or death or severe illness of newborns. What are the limitations of the evidence? Our confidence in the evidence from this study is limited because nearly a third of the women included were not followed up or withdrew from the study. We do not know whether these women became pregnant and what their outcomes were. How up to date is this evidence? The evidence is current to January 2025.

AB  -  Abstract - Background The prevalence of epilepsy among people with intellectual disabilities is much higher than in the general population. Seizures in this population are often complex and refractory to treatment and antiepileptic medication may have a profound effect upon behaviour ( Kerr 1997 ). This is an updated version of a Cochrane Review first published in Issue 3, 2007. Objectives To assess the data available from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of the efficacy of antiepileptic drug (AED) interventions in people with epilepsy and intellectual disabilities. Search methods For the latest update of this review, we searched the Cochrane Epilepsy Group Specialised Register (2 September 2014), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) via the Cochrane Register of Studies Online (CRSO) (2 September 2014), MEDLINE (Ovid, 1946 to 3 September 2014) and PsycINFO (EBSCOhost, 1887 to 3 September 2014). Selection criteria Randomised and quasi‐randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of pharmacological interventions for people with epilepsy and a learning disability. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. We contacted study authors for additional information. We assessed epilepsy/seizure, behavioural and cognitive outcomes, as well as quality of life and adverse effects. Main results We included 14 RCTs (1116 participants) in the present review. Data were heterogenous and a descriptive analysis is presented. In the majority of cases where antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) were trialled in this population, we found moderate reductions in seizure frequency in that there was a significantly higher rate of responders (reduction of 50% or more) in the treatment group compared with the placebo group, with some studies reporting a higher incidence of seizure freedom in the treatment group. In general, AEDs that are proven to be effective in the general epilepsy population are also effective for refractory epilepsy in people with intellectual disability. It is not possible to comment on the relative efficacy of medications, making clinical decisions difficult. In trial settings patients continued on treatment in the majority of cases. Placebo groups often experienced fewer adverse events. Where adverse events were experienced they appeared similar to those in the general population. The methods by which adverse events were recorded and reported appeared to be inconsistent, resulting in very large variation between studies. This is problematic as clinically relevant interpretation of these findings is limited. The quality of evidence provided in the present review is low to moderate. Additionally the majority of studies lacked or used non‐reliable measures of behavioural exacerbation. However, where measured, little obvious impact on behaviour was seen in terms of behaviour disorder. Authors' conclusions This review broadly supports the use of AEDs to reduce seizure frequency in people with refractory epilepsy and intellectual disability. The evidence suggests that adverse events are similar to those in the general population and that behavioural adverse events leading to discontinuation are rare; however, other adverse effects are under‐researched. Plain language summary Pharmacological interventions for epilepsy in people with intellectual disability Background Epilepsy is a common condition. Approximately 3% of the general population are diagnosed with epilepsy at some point in their life ( Rugg‐Gunn 2012 ). However, epilepsy is significantly more common in people with intellectual disabilities where estimates range from 14% to 44% ( Bowley 2000 ). People with intellectual disability and epilepsy often do not respond as well to antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) as the general population and behavioural disturbances are frequent. We review the use of AEDs in this population. Study characteristics The evidence is current to 2 September 2014. The included studies assessed the effectiveness of pharmacological interventions in people with epilepsy and intellectual disability. In total we included 14 studies and data from 1116 participants in the present review update. Five studies were funded by pharmaceutical companies, seven studies had insufficient information regarding how the trial was funded and one study was free from other bias. Key results This updated review confirms that in the majority of cases where intellectually disabled populations participated in trials of AEDs, moderate reductions in seizure frequency and occasional seizure freedom were obtained. The present update found that participants in the AED groups were more likely to report a 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency compared with the control groups. The results also suggested that participants in the AED group were more likely to become seizure‐free and report a 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency compared with participants in the placebo group, however these results were not significant. Additionally, the results of the present update suggest that more participants in the AED groups withdrew from treatment and reported adverse effects compared with the placebo group, however these results were also not significant. Where adverse events were reported they appeared to be similar to those seen in people without intellectual disability and thus they were not specific to this population. In summary, this review broadly supports the use of AEDs to reduce seizure frequency in patients with refractory epilepsy and intellectual disability. Side effects seem to be the same as in people with epilepsy without intellectual disabilities and behavioural adverse events leading to withdrawal from the treatment are rare. Quality of the evidence The quality of evidence provided by this review is low to moderate. There is a large amount of variation across the studies in that different studies used different AEDs and reported different outcomes. Due to the inconsistencies between studies, not all studies could be included in the meta‐analyses. Therefore the statistical analysis in the present update is limited. Overall there appear to be very few high quality studies assessing pharmacological interventions for people with epilepsy and intellectual disability. We hope that further research will be conducted in this area to provide a more thorough understanding.
