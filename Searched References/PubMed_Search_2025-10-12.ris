AB  - Urinary stone diseases are increasing in the Middle East. The majority of urinary stone cases are found in the northern part of the country. Stone samples taken from patients living in the Irbid area were collected from Princess Basma Hospital. The present study concentrates on the mineralogical and chemical composition of the urinary stones and on the effective environmental factors that assist in developing the different types of urinary stones. Using X-ray diffraction techniques, the mineralogical composition of the urinary stones was found to be as follows: oxalate, cholesten, and uric acid, with cystine stones occuring more frequently than the others. Cholesten and calcium oxalate stones are the most dominant types of stones. Calcium oxalate is the most common type of oxalate stone. Calcium oxalate is represented in: whewellite, wheddellite, and calcium carbonate oxalate hydrate minerals, in addition to other minerals such as brushite, ammonium phosphate, vaterite, valleriite, and bobierrite from other types of stones. Bobierrite (phosphate group) is a new mineral reported in urinary stones, and this has not been determined in any previous study worldwide. Apatite (calcium phosphate) is deduced using scanning electron microscope (SEM) images. The SEM technique determined crystal forms and systems, shapes, morphological features, and the names of the minerals forming urine stones, while optical properties are studied by polarizing microscope. X-ray fluorescence technique determined the concentrations of major and some trace elements. It revealed that Ca is the main constituent of the urinary stones, especially those composed of calcium oxalate and calcium phosphate. The concentration of trace elements was Ba = 1.57, P = 3.61, Fe = 1.78, S = 2.08, Zr = 4.63, Mo = 3.92, Cu = 1.89, Co = 1.56, and F = 4.2% and was higher in the urinary stones of Jordanian patients than in foreigners in the country. Questionnaires completed by patients suggest that the most significant factors directly effecting the formation of stones are water, climate conditions, food rich in protein and rich in different chemicals. Moreover, some drugs and diseases might also help in developing other stones.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The beneficial effects of oral supplements with alkalinizing agents in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) have been limited to the severe stages. We investigated whether two types of supplements, sodium bicarbonate (SB) and potassium citrate/sodium citrate (PCSC), could maintain renal function in patients with mild-stage CKD. METHODS: This was a single-center, open-labeled, randomized cohort trial. Study participants with CKD stages G2, G3a, and G3b were enrolled between March 2013 and January 2019 and randomly assigned by stratification according to age, sex, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and diabetes. They were followed up for 6 months (short-term study) for the primary endpoints and extended to 2 years (long-term study) for the secondary endpoints. Supplementary doses were adjusted to achieve an early morning urinary pH of 6.8-7.2. We observed renal dysfunction or new-onset cerebrovascular disease and evaluated urinary surrogate markers for renal injury. RESULTS: Overall, 101 participants were registered and allocated to three groups: standard (n = 32), SB (n = 34), and PCSC (n = 35). Two patients in the standard group attained the primary endpoints (renal stones and overt proteinuria) but were not statistically significant. There was one patient in the standard reduced eGFR during the long-term study (p = 0.042 by ANOVA). SB increased proteinuria (p = 0.0139, baseline vs. 6 months), whereas PCSC significantly reduced proteinuria (p = 0.0061, baseline vs. 1 year, or p = 0.0186, vs. 2 years) and urinary excretion of 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (p = 0.0481, baseline vs. 6 months). CONCLUSION: This study is the first to report supplementation of PCSC reduced intrarenal oxidative stress in patients with mild-stage CKD.

AB  - This case report records an obstructive urolithiasis due to a large calcium carbonate urethral stone in an 11-year-old Arabian stallion. The stallion had colicky pain, anuria, and reduction in food and water intakes. Palpation of the penis revealed rhythmic contractions of the urethra, a hard mass in the penile urethra at the level of the ischial arch, and a dilated urethra proximal to the mass. Rectal examination revealed a distended and turgid urinary bladder. Passing a urethral catheter revealed a complete urethral obstruction at the level of the ischial arch. Ultrasonography revealed a calculus that appeared as an irregular, hyperechoic arch-like thick line with acoustic shadowing. Subischial urethrotomy was conducted under epidural anesthesia. Uneventful recovery was seen with no recurrence or complications for 12 months of available follow-up. In conclusion, clinical, rectal, and ultrasound examinations are valuable for definite diagnosis of urethral calculi in horses and the subischial urethrotomy appears to be successful in correcting this condition in horses.

AB  - Carbonic anhydrases are a group of isoenzymes that catalyze the reversible conversion of carbon dioxide into bicarbonate. They participate in a constellation of physiological processes in humans, including respiration, bone metabolism, and the formation of body fluids, including urine, bile, pancreatic juice, gastric secretion, saliva, aqueous humor, cerebrospinal fluid, and sweat. In addition, carbonic anhydrase may provide carbon dioxide/bicarbonate to carboxylation reactions that incorporate carbon dioxide to substrates. Several isoforms of carbonic anhydrase have been identified in humans, but their precise physiological role and the consequences of their dysfunction are mostly unknown. Carbonic anhydrase isoenzymes are involved in calcification processes in a number of biological systems, including the formation of calcareous spicules from sponges, the formation of shell in some animals, and the precipitation of calcium salts induced by several microorganisms, particularly urease-producing bacteria. In human tissues, carbonic anhydrase is implicated in calcification processes either directly by facilitating calcium carbonate deposition which in turn serves to facilitate calcium phosphate mineralization, or indirectly via its action upon gamma-glutamyl-carboxylase, a carboxylase that enables the biological activation of proteins involved in calcification, such as matrix Gla protein, bone Gla protein, and Gla-rich protein. Carbonic anhydrase is implicated in calcification of human tissues, including bone and soft-tissue calcification in rheumatological disorders such as ankylosing spondylitis and dermatomyositis. Carbonic anhydrase may be also involved in bile and kidney stone formation and carcinoma-associated microcalcifications. The aim of this review is to evaluate the possible association between carbonic anhydrase isoenzymes and vascular calcification in humans.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The composition of urinary stones in children depends on socioeconomic conditions, geography and dietary habits. Pediatric urolithiasis remains endemic in developing countries. The aim of this study was to analyze stone composition in an Egyptian patient population. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analyzed prospectively urinary stones from 100 consecutive children (73 males, 27 females), aged 14 months to 12 years. The stones were located in the upper urinary tract in 78%, lower urinary tract in 19% and both in 3%. Male patients had more lower urinary tract stones. On presentation 67% had flank pain and 37% had hematuria. Stones were treated by open surgery in 69% of patients, shockwave lithotripsy in 20% and endoscopic extraction in 13%. RESULTS: The components of the upper urinary tract calculi were calcium oxalate (47%), ammonium acid urate (26%) and calcium carbonate (21%), whereas the main components of the lower urinary tract calculi were ammonium acid urate (27.2%), struvite (27.2%) and calcium carbonate (22.7%). Urinary tract infection was involved in the development of one third of the stones. Endemic stones were present in 17% of patients, and stones of metabolic origin in 15%. The etiology of stone formation remained unknown in one third of patients. CONCLUSION: The epidemiological profile of urinary stones in Egyptian children can now be considered intermediate between developing countries where dietary deficiencies are the main causes and developed countries where infectious and metabolic calculi are observed.

AB  - The influence of certain dietary elements on the urolithiasis syndrome in cattle calves was elucidated. Calcium, phosphorus, and magnesium measurements were conducted on feed rations as well as on serum and urine samples collected from affected and normal calves. Analysis of the rations given to the animals showed phosphorus at higher levels than calcium, indicating mineral imbalance. Serum and urine of urolithic calves were characterised by high phosphorus, calcium, magnesium, urea, and creatinine levels. Physical examination of urine of affected animals showed a high degree of turbidity, a large amount of calcium carbonate, and triple phosphate as well as abundant amount of pus cells and red blood cells. The characteristic clinical symptoms of urine retention were observed. Moreover, some animals were found to urinate through an opening in front of the scrotal region.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Carbonic anhydrase (CA) II deficiency is a rare autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutation in the CA II gene that leads to osteopetrosis, renal tubular acidosis (RTA), and cerebral calcification. Our aim is to present a patient with the classic triad of CA II deficiency syndrome to enhance the awareness about this rare syndrome. METHODS: We describe the clinical and radiological findings of a Saudi woman patient with CA II deficiency syndrome. RESULTS: A Saudi woman in her 20s presented to our hospital for evaluation of increased bone density. She was known to have delayed developmental milestone with growth retardation and poor scholastic performance. She had multiple fragile fractures started at the age of 15 involving the lower extremities. A physical examination revealed dysmorphic features and intellectual disability with intelligence quotient (IQ) of 36. The initial blood workup showed a picture of distal RTA with hypokalemia, and the radiological imaging confirmed the presence of osteopetrosis and multiple kidney stones. The combination of osteopetrosis with RTA raised the possibility of CA II deficiency. Therefore, computed tomography (CT) of the brain was done and showed intracranial calcification involving the basal ganglia. She was started on potassium chloride and sodium bicarbonate. In addition, she underwent right-sided percutaneous nephrolithotripsy. Her DNA analysis came to show a sequence variant c.232+1G>A, which was detected in both of the CA II genes (homozygous). CONCLUSION: Early recognition of the disease is a key, as an early appropriate treatment institution is essential in order to prevent further complications.

AB  - SUMMARY: Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) is a rare inherited endocrine disorder with a high rate of penetrance. The incidence of MEN1 is 1/30,000 in the general population; however, it is quite rare for a patient to present for medical attention with MEN1 for the first time in pregnancy. Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is one of the most common features of MEN1. The incidence of PHPT occurring in pregnancy is 1%. Despite advances in the medical, surgical and obstetric care over the years, management of this condition during pregnancy may be challenging. It can be difficult to identify pregnant women with PHPT requiring intervention and to monitor safely. Hypercalcemia can result in significant maternal and fetal adverse outcomes including: miscarriage, intrauterine growth restriction, preterm delivery, neonatal hypocalcaemia, pre-eclampsia and maternal nephrolithiasis. Herein, we present a case study of a lady with a strong family history of MEN1, who was biochemically proven to have PHPT and evidence of Zollinger Ellison Syndrome (ZE) on endoscopy. This patient delayed her assisted pregnancy plans for in vitro fertilization (IVF) until completion of the MEN1 workup; nevertheless, she spontaneously achieved an unplanned pregnancy. As a result, she required intervention with parathyroidectomy in the second trimester of her pregnancy as her calcium level continued to rise. This case study highlights the workup, follow up and management of MEN1 presenting with PHPT and ZE in pregnancy. LEARNING POINTS: Women of childbearing age who are suspected to have a diagnosis of primary hyperparathyroidism ideally should have genetic testing and avoid pregnancy until definitive plans are in place. Zollinger Ellison syndrome in pregnancy means off-label use of high dose of proton pump inhibitors (PPI). Use of PPI in pregnancy is considered to be safe based on retrospective studies. Omeprazole, however, is FDA class C drug because of lack of large prospective studies or large case series during pregnancy. Calcium supplements in the form of calcium carbonate must be converted to calcium chloride by gastric acid in order to be absorbed, however, patients rendered achlorhydric as a result of PPI use will have impaired absorption of calcium. Therefore, use of calcium citrate might be considered a better option in this case.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Giant bladder calculi are not common in modern urologic practice and many have been found to grow to enormous proportions with minimal symptoms. METHOD: We report a 1.6 kg stone removed from the urinary bladder of a 48 year old Nigerian man. The stone increase in size associated with troublesome urinary frequency, which necessitated removal by open vesicolithotomy. RESULTS: The calculus weighed 1.6 kg and measured 3cm x 9.5cm x 9.2cm in length breadth and height; and contained calcium carbonate, calcium oxalate, magnesium phosphate and uric acid. It was a complex stone, sticking to the hypertrophied bladder wall. A biopsy of the bladder mucosa revealed no malignancy. The patient was on continuous bladder drainage for 10 days and had a urine flow rate of 20 mls/sec on discharge. He has been seen in the surgical outpatient department 2 weeks and 4 weeks after discharge with no complaints. CONCLUSION: Giant vesical calculi are rare and can present with few symptoms. It is very important to exclude lower urinary tract obstruction as the aetiology though a significant number have no such obstruction. The stones are usually mixed because of associated urinary tract infection.

AB  - We describe a model to illustrate different chemical interactions that can occur in urine following ingestion of individual and combined health supplements. Two types of interactions are defined: synergism and addition. The model was applied to eight healthy males who participated in a study to investigate the chemical interactions between calcium carbonate, magnesium oxide and sodium citrate-bicarbonate health supplements on calcium oxalate urinary stone risk factors. Subjects ingested these components individually and in combination for 7 days. Twenty-four-hour urines were collected at baseline and during the final day of supplementation. These were analysed using standard laboratory techniques. Three different chemical interactions, all involving citrate, were identified: magnesium and citrate exerted a synergistic effect on lowering the relative superaturation (RS) of brushite; the same two components produced a synergistic effect on raising pH; finally, calcium and citrate exerted an additive effect on lowering the RS of uric acid. We propose that the novel approach described in this paper allows for the evaluation of individual, additive and synergistic interactions in the assessment of the efficacy of stone-risk reducing preparations.

AB  - The occurrence of silicon dioxide in human urinary calculi is more common than generally believed. During a 3 year study we have analyzed about 750 human urinary calculi using the scanning electron microscope and x-ray crystallographic methods. Silicon dioxide of the alpha quartz variety was found to be the principal constituent in calculi from 5 male patients. Some of the patients were recurrent stone formers and 1 patient has previously produced a silicon dioxide calculus. In none of the 5 cases was there any history of gastric disorders or of any ingestion of antacids in the form of magnesium trisilicate. Some of the silica particles have a morphology typical of glacial sand.

AB  - The mechanism(s) by which crystals are retained in the kidney resulting in stone disease remains unclear. Intratubular aggregation as well as crystal cell binding, or internalization and translocation, or alternatively nucleation and growth in the interstitial fluid are possible models. Our group is testing the hypothesis that calcium phosphate deposits in kidneys of patients with calcium renal stones arise in unique anatomical regions of the kidney. Furthermore, we believe that their formation is conditioned by specific stone forming pathophysiologies. To test this hypothesis, we performed intra-operative renal papillary biopsies during percutaneous nephrolithotomy of kidneys from 15 idiopathic calcium stone formers as well as kidney tissue from a patient who ingested ethylene glycol, and developed a new protocol to accurately identify the composition of the calcium deposits located in the renal tissue. We developed a new histological approach that incorporated a low-energy (low-E) reflective slide substrate that has similar characteristics to a common microscope slide and infrared absorption microspectroscopy. Infrared absorption microspectroscopy revealed the crystal deposits in the idiopathic calcium oxalate stone formers to be hydroxyapatite in composition with an occasional region of calcium carbonate, while calcium oxalate was the predominant mineral in the kidney of the patient who had ingested ethylene glycol. The results demonstrate that mixed sample types containing tissue and mineralized deposits are easily analyzed while mounted on a low-E slide using the attenuated total internal reflectance (ATR) method. Reflection/absorption (R/A) analysis allows one to quickly survey a tissue section and provides qualitative information about its components. Once interesting sites have been identified by R/A analysis, ATR analysis can then be used to collect the best data possible. ATR analysis provides spectra free from many of the artifacts associated with transmission and R/A analysis, and completes the full picture of the components contained in the crystal deposits and tissue. We present a method of analysis for mineralized materials embedded in kidney tissue that uses readily or easily obtainable materials and instrumentation. The sensitivity of this method allows tissue sections to remain unstained, alleviating the tedious and time-consuming constraints of earlier methods of visual analysis. The present method will save time and training, while simultaneously offering an unbiased analysis of mineralized components that is more accurate and conducive to patient treatments than previous methods.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe the treatment of goats with urethral obstruction secondary to urolithiasis by combining tube cystostomy and urethrotomy. ANIMALS: Eight male goats. STUDY DESIGN: Short case series. METHODS: Medical records (September 2012-September 2017) of male goats treated for obstruction secondary to urolithiasis with tube cystostomy and urethrotomy were reviewed. Data collected included signalment, history, physical examination findings, diagnostic results, perioperative treatments, operative details, hospitalization duration, intraoperative and postoperative complications, urolith analysis, and time to restoration of urethral patency. Long-term follow-up (>12 months) was obtained by email or telephone interviews of owners or by clinical examination. RESULTS: Seven of eight goats were castrated males of various of breeds. All goats were tachycardic with urethral pulsation at admission. Uroliths were composed of calcium carbonate in four goats and silica in one goat. All goats regained urethral patency during hospitalization, and all were discharged alive from the hospital. Seven goats were alive at long-term follow-up. Postoperative complications included persistent urethral obstruction requiring a second urethrotomy 2 days postoperatively, premature dislodgement of the bladder catheter and jejunal obstruction secondary to adhesions, and recurrence of obstructive urolithiasis within the proximal perineal urethra requiring a second surgery 8 months later (1 each). Long-term outcome was good, with urethral patency beyond 12 months in six of eight goats. CONCLUSION: Combining tube cystostomy and urethrotomy restored urethral patency in goats with urethral obstruction from uroliths. Although none of the complications seemed directly related to the urethrotomy, formation of abdominal adhesions and recurrence of urolithiasis affected long-term outcomes. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Uroliths that do not dissolve in acidic urine may be more frequent in some practices. The combined approach of tube cystostomy and urethrotomy appears to successfully restore urethral patency with promising long-term outcomes.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The choice of ideal treatment for a given lithiasis is a crucial factor for its success, minimizing the number of interventions and complications. Previous determination of stone composition and its fragility is desirable, to predict its behavior during extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy and for evaluation of its appropriateness, or to set the indication for other techniques. OBJETIVES: To determine the role of densitometry in the prediction of composition and fragility of urinary lithiasis undergoing SWL. METHODS: Experimental prospective, blinded, in vitro study using 193 urinary calculi of known composition : monohydrated calcium oxalate, mixed calcium oxalate, uric acid, and calcium carbonate, obtained from spontaneous passage or surgery. Densitometry and SWL were performed on them. We compare the mineral composition of the stone and mineral density of each composition group to check if they are characteristic of each type and correlate these parameters with the energy dose required to fragment them down to a given fragment size. RESULTS: Only 53 out of 193 stones showed valuable data. Calcium carbonate was the composition showing grater mineral content and density (1,24 gr and 0,47 gr/cm2), followed by mixed oxalate (0,51/0,26) and uric acid (0,52/ 0,15), finishing with the monohydrate calcium oxalate group (0,32/0,05).Only the comparison between calcium carbonate and monohydrated calcium oxalate showed statistically significant results (p<0,05). Correlation coefficients between mineral content (0,347) and density (0,424) and the energy used for stone fragmentation to a given fragment size were statistically significant (p<0,05) CONCLUSIONS: In our study, the use of densitometry to determine stone composition and lithiasic fragility did not show conclusive results due to the limited number of calculi tested. Nevertheless, there are signs that, with a different study design , more practically useful results could be achieved.

AB  - EPIDEMIOLOGY: The annual incidence of urolithiasis in the population is at least 0.1%. In rural areas, there are remarkably less actual stone formers than in urban districts, and also vegetarians show less stone diseases. Calcium carbonate as a urinary calculus compound is not in the strict sense impossible, but often an artifact. About 10% of homozygotic cystinuria patients never suffer an actual stone disease. PATHOGENESIS: It is obvious that for stone formation urinary supersaturation alone is not sufficient. Besides the well-known inhibitors like citrate, magnesium and pyrophosphate there have to be other important urinary constituents. Risk factors are high protein or glucose intakes and, in general, hyperalimentation, simply because any food has to be deplenished somehow and increases the urine concentration. A special cause may be found in alterations of the renal tubuli. Diagnostic: For the quite difficult oxalate analysis, an enzymatic test is commercially available. Up to now, the most important analytical task in urolithiasis is still the correct analysis of urinary calculi. Qualitative chemical analysis shows up to 50% erroneous results, leading to false therapies. To determine the calculus compounds the best appropriate method is by far the X-ray diffraction analysis. THERAPY: The results with adsorption medicines are contradictory. Satisfactory therapies are given for uricosuria with allopurinol and for oxaluria with pyridoxine. A new therapy for cystinuria may be the combined application of ascorbic acid and sodium hydrogen carbonate.

AB  - We have used published rat micropuncture data to construct a matrix of ion concentrations along the rat nephron. With an iterative computer model of known ion interactions, we calculated relative supersaturation ratios in all nephron segments. The collecting ducts and urine showed expected supersaturation with stone-forming salts. Fluid in the thin segment of the loop of Henle may be supersaturated with calcium carbonate and calcium phosphate under certain conditions. Because calculations cannot predict the actual course of crystallization, we made solutions to mimic, in vitro, presumed conditions in the loop of Henle. The solid phases that formed were analyzed by X-ray powder diffraction, electron microprobe, and infrared spectroscopy. All samples were identified as poorly crystallized or immature apatite. The descending limb of Henle's loop creates a unique condition as it extracts water but not sodium, bicarbonate, calcium, or phosphate, giving a calcium concentration at the bend of 3 mM, pH 7.4, and a phosphate concentration that varies from 0.8 to 48 mM, depending on parathyroid hormone and dietary phosphate. We conclude that conditions in the thin segment potentially could create a solid calcium phosphate phase, which may initiate nucleation of calcium oxalate salts in the collecting ducts, potentiating nephrolithiasis and nephrocalcinosis.

AB  - During about ten years, nephrocalcin was considered the main calcium oxalate crystal growth inhibitor. Today, it appears only a urinary protein inhibitor among other ones such as non polymerized Tamm-Horsfall protein, uropontin or crystal matrix protein (CMP), a protein derived from prothrombin. All these molecules are able to inhibit either crystal growth or aggregation of calcium oxalate in urine. Another protein, named renal lithostathine, was also reported to be a potent inhibitor of secondary nucleation and growth of calcium carbonate crystals. A new urinary inhibitor of calcium oxalate formation was isolated from the urine of healthy subjects using chromatographic procedures. It is a macromolecule with a molecular weight (MW) of approximately 35 kDa as estimated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Its carbohydrate content represents an average of 8.5% of its MW. Glutamic and aspartic acids represent 24% of total amino acids. This protein is called Uronic-Acid-rich Protein (UAP) because of its uronic acid content. The same protein isolated from the urine of stone formers showed less inhibitory activity than that purified from the urine of healthy subjects. Structural modifications may explain this diminution of its inhibitory activity. This protein was also purified from rat urine using same procedures. Human and rat UAP exhibit similar biochemical characteristics and strongly inhibit calcium oxalate crystallization in vitro. Partial amino acid sequence analysis showed a homology with inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor (ITI), confirmed by the immunological results on Western blot. Nevertheless, various chemical and enzymic treatments revealed that UAP and ITI are not identical molecules. Consequently, urine contains several macromolecular substances belonging to ITI superfamily which are involved in the inhibition of calcium oxalate crystallization. UAP takes place among the most efficient macromolecular substances known as inhibitors in calcium oxalate nephrolithiasis.

AB  - Obstructive and incidental urolithiasis cases were evaluated in 5 Asian colobine monkey species (n= 21 individuals) that included 12 silvery langurs (Trachypithecus cristatus), 6 spectacled langurs (Trachypithecus obscurus), 1 Javan langur (Trachypithecus auratus auratus), 1 Francois' langur (Trachypithecus francoisi), and 1 red-shanked douc langur (Pygathrix nemaeus) from eight zoologic institutions. All institutions that responded were Association of Zoos and Aquariums, European Association of Zoos and Aquaria, or World Association of Zoos and Aquariums accredited. Males were more commonly represented in the total number of cases (86%), and all cases of obstructive urolithiasis occurred in males. The most common clinical signs observed in obstructive cases included stranguria (58.8%), lethargy (41.2%), anorexia (29.4%), depression (17.6%), and penile manipulation (11.8%). Clinicopathologic abnormalities revealed azotemia (76.5%), anemia (35.3%), and hyperkalemia (23.5%). Eleven of the 21 cases included urinalysis results, and crystalluria was reported in all 11. Obstructive cases were more commonly managed surgically, with medical management following. Instances of individual obstruction ranged from 0 (incidental finding) to 18, with a median of 8 (mean of 4.3) recurrent obstructions. A total of 39 urolith analyses were available from 17 of 21 cases, with calcium carbonate being the most common type isolated (37 of 39, 94.9%). Calcium oxalate was observed in the remaining 5.1% of cases (2 of 39). No cases exhibited a consistent match of crystalluria and urolith type. Death or euthanasia secondary to obstructive urolithiasis occurred in 52.4% of cases. Urinary obstruction secondary to urolithiasis appears to be a relevant cause of morbidity and mortality in Asian colobine species, and further study into etiology and preventive medicine should be undertaken.

AB  - The influence of calcium carbonate, aluminium oxyhydrate (Andursil) and an anion exchanger (Colestid) on the absorption of oxalate from the intestine in rats was investigated. The animals were administered daily doses of 15mg oxalate as a 14C-sodium-oxalate solution by means of a throat probe, and the substances of interest were mixed with the food. The intake of food and the 14C-activity in the urine were measured during four urine-collecting periods of 3 days each. The quantity of the enterally administered oxalate excreted with urine has a negative correlation to the amount of the investigated test substances ingested with food.

AB  - To explore the relationship between citrus fruit juices (oranges, grapefruits, and lemonades) and kidney stone disease (KSD). METHODS: A systematic review was performed using the Medline, EMBASE, and Scopus databases, in concordance with the PRISMA checklist for all English, French, and Spanish language studies regarding the consumption of citrus fruit juices and the relationship to urinary stone disease. The main outcome of interest was the association of citrus fruit juices with KSD. RESULTS: Thirteen articles met the criteria for inclusion in the final review. Three large epidemiological studies found that grapefruit juice was a risk factor for stone formation, while orange juice did not increase the risk for KSD. Ten small prospective clinical studies found that orange, grapefruit, and lemon juices all increased urinary citrate levels. Only orange and grapefruit juices had an alkalinizing effect and while lemon juice has a protective effect by raising urinary citrate levels, it lacked a significant alkalinizing effect on urine pH. Orange juice and grapefruit juices significantly increased urinary oxalate levels, while orange juice also had a high carbohydrate content. CONCLUSION: While orange juice seems to play a protective role against stone formation, grapefruit was found to raise the risk of KSD in epidemiological studies but had a protective role in smaller clinical studies. Lemon juice had a smaller protective role than orange juice. Larger amounts of, as well as more accurate, data is needed before recommendations can be made and a high carbohydrate content in these juices needs to be taken into consideration.

AB  - Female patient, suffering from nephrolithiasis, at the age of 32 was admitted for renal colic caused by a stone obstructing UP junction with left hydronephrosis. Nephrostomy was placed, resulting in brisk diuresis. Severe metabolic acidosis with normal anion gap and urine pH of 6.5 was noted. Potassium level dropped to extremely low level (1.6 mEq/L), causing muscle paralysis and respiratory failure, necessitating mechanical ventilation. The patient was treated by potassium chloride infusion, followed by correction of severe metabolic acidosis by sodium bicarbonate. Diagnosis of distal type renal tubular acidosis type I (dRTA) was made based on normal anion gap metabolic acidosis, alkaline urine, hypokalemia, and nephrolithiasis. Five years later, the patient presented with severe hypoxia, lung opacities, and bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia which was confirmed by bronchoscopy with lung tissue biopsy. Concurrently, the patient presented with dry mouth, pruritus, skin rash with hypocomplementemia, elevated anti-DNA, anti-Ro, and anti-SmAb. Diagnosis of overlap Sjogren's/systemic lupus erythematosus disease was done and treatment by hydroxychloroquine, prednisone, and azathioprine was started. Possible presence of Sjogren's syndrome should be considered in adult patients with unexplained dRTA.

AB  - This Journal feature begins with a case vignette highlighting a common clinical problem. Evidence supporting various strategies is then presented, followed by a review of formal guidelines, when they exist. The article ends with the author's clinical recommendations. A 62-year-old healthy woman presents for routine care. She has no history of fracture, but she is worried about osteoporosis because her mother had a hip fracture at 72 years of age. She exercises regularly and has taken over-the-counter calcium carbonate at a dose of 1000 mg three times a day since her menopause at 54 years of age. This regimen provides 1200 mg of elemental calcium per day. She eats a healthy diet with multiple servings of fruits and vegetables and consumes one 8-oz serving of low-fat yogurt and one glass of low-fat milk almost every day. She recently heard that calcium supplements could increase her risk of cardiovascular disease and wants your opinion about whether or not she should receive them. What would you advise?

AB  - Oral alkalization with sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO(3) ) or citrate is prescribed for conditions ranging from metabolic acidosis to nephrolithiasis. Although most nephrologists/urologists use this method routinely, extracellular volume (ECV) increase is the main feared adverse event reported for NaHCO(3) . Thus far, no trial has specifically studied this issue in a real-world setting. AlcalUN (NCT03035812) is a multicentric, prospective, open-label cohort study with nationwide (France) enrollment in 18 (public and private) nephrology/urology units. Participants were adult outpatients requiring chronic (>1 month) oral alkalization by either NaHCO(3) -containing or no-NaHCO(3) -containing agents. The ECV increase (primary outcome) was judged based on body weight increase (DeltaBW), blood pressure increase (DeltaBP), and/or new-onset edema at the first follow-up visit (V1). From February 2017 to February 2020, 156 patients were enrolled. After a median 106 days of treatment, 91 (72%) patients reached the primary outcome. They had lower systolic (135 (125, 141) vs. 141 (130, 150), P = 0.02) and diastolic (77 (67, 85) vs. 85 (73, 90), P = 0.03) BP values, a higher plasma chloride (106.0 (105.0, 109.0) vs. 105.0 (102.0, 107.0), P = 0.02) at baseline, and a less frequent history of nephrolithiasis (32 vs. 56%, P = 0.02). Patients experienced mainly slight DeltaBP (< 10 mmHg). The primary outcome was not associated (P = 0.79) with the study treatment (129 received NaHCO(3) and 27 received citrate). We subsequently developed three different models of propensity score matching; each confirmed our results. Chronic oral alkalization with NaHCO(3) is no longer associated with an ECV increase compared to citrate in real-life settings.

AB  - The effect of citrate on calcium oxalate (CaOx) crystal growth was studied in a system in which series of samples containing [45Ca]calcium chloride were brought to different levels of supersaturation with various concentrations of oxalate. The crystallization was assessed by measuring the amount of isotope remaining in solution 30 min after the addition of CaOx seed crystals to samples containing citrate in concentrations corresponding to those in final urine. The experiments were carried out both in pure salt solutions and in solutions with dialysed urine. Increased concentrations of citrate resulted in a reduced crystallization of CaOx in both the presence and absence of dialysed urine, but with the lowest rate of crystallization in the samples containing urine. The increased concentration of 45Ca remaining in solution reflected a reduced crystallization, which could possibly be explained both by a reduced supersaturation and by an increased inhibition of CaOx crystal growth. The direct effects of citrate on CaOx crystal growth were assessed by calculating the ion-activity product of CaOx (APCaOx) at corresponding degrees of crystallization. The APCaOx recorded at a 30% reduction of the amount of isotope in solution increased with increasing concentrations of citrate between 1.0 and 1.5 mmol/l samples both with and without dialysed urine. These findings indicate that citrate has a weak direct inhibitory effect on CaOx crystal growth, which adds to the reduced growth rate brought about by urinary macromolecules and a decreased supersaturation.

AB  - Calcium oxalate (CaOx) is the most common constituent of calcium renal stones, often mixed with calcium phosphate (CaP). The recurrence rate of these stones is high and their aetiology complex. Despite new effective, less invasive methods to remove the stones, preventive treatment is often necessary to avoid recurrence. Alkaline citrate is a relatively new medical treatment reported to give a stone free rate of between 67-92 per cent in long term studies with three daily doses. The present investigation was undertaken in order to study further the risk factors in CaOx stone formation, the influence and usefulness of a single evening dose of alkaline citrate, and the value of a four hour morning urine sample in the evaluation of patients who form stones. The highest CaOx crystallisation risk (CaOx-CR) in whole urine was recorded in the pH range 4.5-5.5, with lower values above this pH. Between pH 6.5-7.5 the number of small CaP crystals was considerably increased. The crystallisation of CaOx on hydroxyapatite (HAP) was inhibited for four hours by 1 and 2% whole urine or citrate in concentrations of 1% that in normal urine. The formation of CaP crystals in a supersaturated system was considerably reduced when citrate concentrations exceeded 0.5 mmol/l. The number of medium sized (6.5-14 microns) and large crystals (15.5-27 microns) was reduced, and small crystals (3.5-5 microns) predominated at higher citrate concentrations. The correlation between the composition of 24-h urine samples and 4-h urine specimens collected between 0600-1000, from patients with CaOx stones before and during a course of alkaline citrate given as a single evening dose was good, with the best correlation recorded during treatment. These results suggest that the 4-h urine sample might be adequate for the follow up of patients treated with alkaline citrate. A total amount of 7.5 g of potassium sodium citrate (PSC) in 1, 2, and 3 doses favourably affected urine composition in patients with CaOx stones. Three doses gave the most sustained effect, and a single evening dose gave the most pronounced effect between 2200-0600. Long term treatment (mean +/- SD duration 3.5 +/- 1.7 years) of patients who formed calcium stones with PSC in a single evening dose of 3.75 or 5.0 g (n = 55) gave a stone free rate of 75 per cent, but no clinical effect was apparent when 5.0 or 7.5 g were given in two or three doses (n = 17).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)

AB  - The authors report an original technique of transintestinal cutaneous diversion using the jejunum A 10 to 15 cm segment of jejunum is raised from the second loop and is attached to the skin transperitoneally. The stoma lies below the ureterojejunal anastomosis and the two ureters, sutured according to Wallace's technique, are implanted end-to-end into the proximal and extraperitonealised end at the height of the sacral promontory. 29 patients have been treated by this technique for various indications: 21 bladder tumors, 5 neurogenic bladders, 1 bladder exstrophy, 1 cervical cancer, 1 prostatic cancer. 15 patients (52%) had previously received pelvic irradiation. The mean follow-up was 47 months (2-192 months) and the mortality was zero. 4 patients (13.8% developed early complications: 2 cases of urinary tract obstruction and 2 intestinal obstructions requiring 3 operations. 6 patients developed 7 minor late complications (24.1%): 2 cases of pyelonephritis, 4 cases of renal stones, only one of which required an operation, and 1 case of prolapsed stoma. None of the patients developed any alteration in renal function or dilatation of the upper urinary tract after the operation. The addition of sodium bicarbonate was found to be useless, as none of the patients developed any metabolic disorders. Transjejunal cutaneous ureterostomy achieves excellent drainage by means of a short graft with a stoma situated below the level of the ureteric implantation, as reflected by the absence of any long-term deterioration in renal function despite full lumen ureterojejunal implantation without an antireflux device. This technique is simple to perform and is indicated in all situations, particularly after pelvic irradiation. It is associated with low morbidity, no mortality and ensures an excellent long-term result.

AB  - Chemical dissolution of residual stone fragments was attempted in twelve instances via nephrostomy tube irrigation. Appropriate solutions containing either hemiacidrin or sodium bicarbonate were used for struvite and uric acid stones, respectively. Precautions were taken to prevent and recognize outflow obstruction and urinary infection. Seventy-five per cent of the stones so treated were completely dissolved, and there were no major complications. The incidence of retained stones, natural history, and indications for chemical dissolution are reviewed.

AB  - Spinach (Spinacia oleracea L.) is often used as a base vegetable to make green juices that are promoted as healthy dietary alternatives. Spinach is known to contain significant amounts of oxalates, which are toxic and, if consumed regularly, can lead to the development of kidney stones. This research investigates adding 50-500mg increments of calcium carbonate, calcium chloride, calcium citrate and calcium sulphate to 100g of raw homogenates of spinach to determine whether calcium would combine with the soluble oxalate present in the spinach. Calcium chloride was the most effective additive while calcium carbonate was the least effective. The formation of insoluble oxalate after incubation at 25 degrees C for 30min is a simple practical step that can be incorporated into the juicing process. This would make the juice considerably safer to consume on a regular basis.

AB  - The aim of the study was to compare the renal citrate excretion and the degree of urine saturation with calcium oxalate in patients with active calcium oxalate urolithiasis and in healthy subjects under basal conditions and after alkalization. There were 20 women before menopause with calcium stone disease aged 33.5 +/- 7.1 in the first group and 20 healthy women aged 32.3 +/- 7.6 in the second one. Sodium bicarbonate was administrated intravenously in a dose 16.8 g during 2 h. 24h excretion of calcium, magnesium and citrate, the degree of urine saturation with calcium oxalate and pH of urine before and after alkalization were evaluated. Hypocitraturia occurred in 45% of patients under basal conditions. The degree of urine saturation with calcium oxalate was significantly higher in women with nephrolithiasis (p < 0.01). A significant increase of citrate excretion (p < 0.001) and a decrease of calcium excretion (p < 0.05) after alkalization took place in both groups. The degree of urine saturation with calcium oxalate decreased significantly in patients with urolithiasis and in healthy subjects. During acute alkalosis, induced by sodium bicarbonate, increase of citrate excretion was observed in patients with urolithiasis in spite of hypocitraturia under basal conditions. This indicates that kidney function following alkalization is normal in "stone kidney". Significantly decreased saturation of urine with calcium oxalate was due to the decrease of calcium excretion and the increase of citrate excretion. In conclusion, the results show that the use of alkalizing factors in prevention of recurrent calcium urolithiasis is justifiable.

AB  - Effective prevention of recurrent kidney stone disease requires the understanding of the mechanisms of its formation. Numerous in vivo observations have demonstrated that a large number of pathological calcium oxalate kidney stones develop on an apatitic calcium phosphate deposit, known as Randall's plaque. In an attempt to understand the role of the inorganic hydroxyapatite phase in the formation and habits of calcium oxalates, we confined their growth under dynamic physicochemical and flow conditions in a reversible microfluidic channel coated with hydroxyapatite. Using multi-scale characterization techniques including scanning electron and Raman microscopy, we showed the successful formation of carbonated hydroxyapatite as found in Randall's plaque. This was possible due to a new two-step flow seed-mediated growth strategy which allowed us to coat the channel with carbonated hydroxyapatite. Precipitation of calcium oxalates under laminar flow from supersaturated solutions of oxalate and calcium ions showed that the formation of crystals is a substrate and time dependent complex process where diffusion of oxalate ions to the surface of carbonated hydroxyapatite and the solubility of the latter are among the most important steps for the formation of calcium oxalate crystals. Indeed when an oxalate solution was flushed for 24 h, dissolution of the apatite layer and formation of calcium carbonate calcite crystals occurred which seems to promote calcium oxalate crystal formation. Such a growth route has never been observed in vivo in the context of kidney stones. Under our experimental conditions, our results do not show any direct promoting role of carbonated hydroxyapatite in the formation of calcium oxalate crystals, consolidating therefore the important role that macromolecules can play in the process of nucleation and growth of calcium oxalate crystals on Randall's plaque.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine if alternative alkalinizing agents lead to similar changes in 24-hour urine pH and citrate compared to potassium citrate (KCIT). Many stone formers cannot tolerate KCIT due to side effects or cost. In these patients, we have prescribed potassium bicarbonate or sodium bicarbonate as alternative alkali (AA), though their efficacy is unclear. METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study of adult stone formers seen from 2000 to 2018 with 24-hour urine analyses. Two analyses were performed. The first evaluated the alkalinizing and citraturic effects in patients with baseline low urine pH or hypocitraturia off of any alkalinizing medications, who were subsequently treated with either KCIT or AA. The second analysis compared the pH and citrate in patients changing from KCIT to an AA. Reasons for switching were abstracted by chart review and cost savings percentages were calculated using GoodRx medication prices. RESULTS: When starting alkali therapy, the median increase in pH from baseline was 0.64 for KCIT and 0.51 for AA (P???=???.077), and the median increase in citrate from baseline was 231 mg for KCIT and 171 mg for AA (P???=???.109). When switching alkali therapy, median pH and citrate did not significantly change. Hyperkalemia (24%), GI upset (19%), and cost (17%) were the most common reasons cited for switching to an AA. AA represented a savings of 86%-92% compared to KCIT. CONCLUSION: Alternative alkali appear to offer comparable improvements in 24-hour urine parameters and significant cost-savings compared to KCIT.

AB  - Between 1984 and 1986 nineteen patients (20 renal units) were admitted with obstructing uric acid calculi. Seventy-eight percent of all patients with urolithiasis were treated endourologically: 8 kidneys were infected, 8 kidneys were non-functioning and 3 kidneys caused a status colicus. Sodium bicarbonate was used for percutaneous irrigation and all 20 kidneys were cleared within 4 to 18 days. The technique is a valuable adjunct to the ESWL.

AB  - Dissolution of uric acid calculi was studied in vitro. Calculated rate constants were then applied to an in vivo situation. The time required for complete dissolution of a uric acid calculus in a patient on oral alkali therapy can be estimated. Sodium bicarbonate, acetylcysteine, [tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane] and [tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane]-E were tested for relative effectiveness in dissolving uric acid calculi in vitro. In patients who require irrigation for dissolution of uric acid calculi [tris(hydroxymethyl)-aminomethane] is the preferred agent.

AB  - Experimental studies in 10 paraplegic patients showed highly significant reduction in urinary saturation associated with the oral administration of aluminium hydroxide. Only 50 per cent of urine samples from five patients with calculous disease were actually undersaturated, however. During clinical studies in 12 patients with renal calculous disease, four had recurrence or growth of calculi while receiving medication, three had no recurrence during therapy, but new stones appeared after the medication was stopped, and five had no growth or recurrence either during therapy or after its cessation.

AB  - Urinary stone disease is frequent, and characterized by a high recurrence rate. Prevention of recurrent urolithiasis is possible using an appropriate diet with or without medications. Patients should be encouraged to have a high fluid intake. For an adult, urine volume should exceed 2000 ml/day. Diet modification should be done according to the various metabolic factors contributing to the formation of the stone (ie, hypercalciuria, hyperoxaluria, hypocitraturia, hyperuricuria, and so forth). Calcium intake should be around 1000 mg/day, protein intake limited to 1.2 g/kg/day, and salt intake kept to less than 100-150 mEq/jour. For uric acid urolithiasis, patient should limit uric acid intake to less than 500 mg/day. If these dietary manoeuvers fail, one can use thiazide diuretics to treat hypercalciuria, potassium citrate to correct hypocitraturia or sodium bicarbonate to alkalanize urine and prevent uric acid stone formation.

AB  - Renal stone disease is characterized by the differences depending on the age, gender, and the geographic location of the patients. Seventy-five percent of the renal stone components is the calcium (Ca). The most common type of the stones is the Ca oxalate stones, while Ca phosphate, uric acid, struvite, and sistine stones are more rarely reported. Other than these types, triamterene, adenosine, silica, indinavir, and ephedrine stones are also reported in the literature as case reports. However, to the best of our knowledge, aluminum hydroxide stones was not reported reported before. Herein we will report a 38-years-old woman with the history of recurrent renal colic disease whose renal stone was determined as aluminum hydroxide stone in type. Aluminum mineral may be considered in the formation of kidney stones as it is widely used in the field of healthcare and cosmetics.

AB  - Silicate stones are extraordinarily rare in human beings, but when present, they are often associated with ingestion of Magnesium Trisilicate, an antacid medication. However, there have been few case reports of patients who developed silicate stones, without ingestion of Magnesium Trisilicate. Hereby, we present the case of a 67-year-old man who developed acute kidney injury due to obstructive uropathy, detected during his scheduled chemotherapy for his relapsing multiple myeloma. Abdominal ultrasound and CT scan imaging demonstrated multiple non-mobile calcifications in the bladder neck/prostate bed. Stone analysis showed a material resembling silica. This case with silicate urinary tract stone highlights this extra-rare urinary stone in a patient without any identified source of silicate. DOI: 10.52547/ijkd.7044.

AB  - Cell life is possible only if intracellular pH (pHi) oscillations are kept within a very narrow range. Measurement of pHi is therefore a very important parameter when examining cell and organ functions. Several methods have been used to monitor pHi; these include fluorescent dyes and pH sensitive electrodes. In addition, many instruments have been applied to the detection of pHi in living organs even at the level of single cells: NMR and confocal microscopy are just an example. Transport proteins located on the cell membrane and intracellular vesicles are responsible for maintaining the correct pHi. In renal tubular cells these include the sodium hydrogen exchanger (NHE), the sodium-dependent and independent chloride-bicarbonate exchanger (Cl--HCO3-), the sodium bicarbonate co-transport (Na+-HCO3-), the ATP-coupled proton pump (H+-ATPasi) and the ATP-dependent proton-potassium pump (H+-K+-ATPasi). All these carriers have been cloned and it is now clear that there are several isoforms with specific properties. The function of these proteins is closely linked to several hormone blood levels, systemic acid-base status, protein diet content as well as other factors. In addition, these carriers are not homogeneously distributed along the nephron and are sensitive to specific stimuli like interstitial osmolality and luminal fluid flow rate. Finally, it has been recently demonstrated that the pHi may be involved in numerous aspects of cell function, such as metabolism, apoptosis, malignancy and it is implicated in the pathogenesis of particular forms of renal stones (Dent's disease).

AB  - A patient with sarcoidosis and chronic renal failure was treated for hyperphosphatemia with aluminum hydroxide. The subsequent fall in serum phosphorus was followed by the development of hypercalcemia and nephrolithiasis. Corticosteroid therapy normalized the serum calcium and halted the progression of the nephrolithiasis, but did not improve renal function. Hyperphosphatemia may have blocked the expression of sarcoid hypercalcemia in the patient. The mechanism is unclear but inhibition of the synthesis or action of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D may have been involved. Reduction of serum phosphorus may lead to severe hypercalcemia in some patients with sarcoidosis.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Evidence is presented that the fragmentation process of long-pulse Holmium:YAG (Ho:YAG) lithotripsy is governed by photothermal decomposition of the calculi rather than photomechanical or photoacoustical mechanisms as is widely thought. The clinical Ho:YAG laser lithotriptor (2.12 microm, 250 micros) operates in the free-running mode, producing pulse durations much longer than the time required for a sound wave to propagate beyond the optical penetration depth of this wavelength in water. Hence, it is unlikely that shock waves are produced during bubble formation. In addition, the vapor bubble induced by this laser is not spherical. Thus the magnitude of the pressure wave produced at cavitation collapse does not contribute significantly to lithotripsy. STUDY DESIGN/MATERIALS AND METHODS: A fast-flash photography setup was used to capture the dynamics of urinary calculus fragmentation at various delay times following the onset of the Ho:YAG laser pulse. These images were concurrently correlated with pressure measurements obtained with a piezoelectric polyvinylidene-fluoride needle-hydrophone. Stone mass-loss measurements for ablation of urinary calculi (1) in air (dehydrated and hydrated) and in water, and (2) at pre-cooled and at room temperatures were compared. Chemical and composition analyses were performed on the ablation products of several types of Ho:YAG laser irradiated urinary calculi, including calcium oxalate monohydrate (COM), calcium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate (CHPD), magnesium ammonium phosphate hexahydrate (MAPH), cystine, and uric acid calculi. RESULTS: When the optical fiber was placed perpendicularly in contact with the surface of the target, fast-flash photography provided visual evidence that ablation occurred approximately 50 micros after the initiation of the Ho:YAG laser pulse (250-350 micros duration; 375-400 mJ per pulse), long before the collapse of the cavitation bubble. The measured peak acoustical pressure upon cavitation collapse was negligible (< 2 bars), indicating that photomechanical forces were not responsible for the observed fragmentation process. When the fiber was placed in parallel to the calculus surface, the pressure peaks occurring at the collapse of the cavitation were on the order of 20 bars, but no fragmentation occurred. Regardless of fiber orientation, no shock waves were recorded at the beginning of bubble formation. Ablation of COM calculi (a total of 150 J; 0.5 J per pulse at an 8-Hz repetition rate) revealed different Ho:YAG efficiencies for dehydrated calculus, hydrated calculus, and submerged calculus. COM and cystine calculi, pre-cooled at -80 degrees C and then placed in water, yielded lower mass-loss during ablation (20 J, 1.0 J per pulse) compared to the mass-loss of calculi at room temperature. Chemical analyses of the ablated calculi revealed products resulting from thermal decomposition. Calcium carbonate was found in samples composed of COM calculi; calcium pyrophosphate was found in CHPD samples; free sulfur and cysteine were discovered in samples composed of cystine samples; and cyanide was found in samples of uric acid calculi. CONCLUSION: These experimental results provide convincing evidence that long-pulse Ho:YAG laser lithotripsy causes chemical decomposition of urinary calculi as a consequence of a dominant photothermal mechanism.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Urinary pH is an important factor in the preventative management of kidney stones. A variety of options are available for modulating urinary pH, including pharmaceuticals, over the counter (OTC) formulations [such as stone specific OTCs, complementary and alternative medicines (CAMs), and home remedies], and dietary modifications. These options can be overwhelming for both providers and patients and vary with regards to cost, convenience, and efficacy. In the absence of a consolidated central source of information for patients and physicians to reference, our study aims to summarize and analyze the effectiveness of these various treatment approaches to provide a more comprehensive understanding of how common interventions alter urinary pH. METHODS: The PubMed database was used to identify human clinical trials related to pharmacologic and dietary interventions to modify urinary pH. Eligible studies were selected based on the following criteria: (I) observational or interventional study; (II) urinary pH as a reported outcome of the study intervention; (III) inclusion baseline or control urinary pH data; (IV) sufficient presentation of data for analytical purposes. Data was abstracted, and the mean changes in urinary pH for each intervention were compiled and grouped. KEY CONTENT AND FINDINGS: A total of 86 studies met inclusion criteria: 61 were randomized clinical trials, 20 were crossover or prospective studies, and 5 were observational cohort reports. In total, 150 individual experiments with a combined sample size of 2,895 were included. For urinary alkalinization, the most effective pharmaceutical, OTC formulation, and dietary change were sodium bicarbonate, Citro-Soda((R)), and lacto-ovo-vegetarian diet, respectively. For urinary acidification, the most effective interventions were ammonium chloride, methionine, and high protein diet, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our study found that pharmaceuticals are not the only effective options for altering urine pH; select dietary changes and OTC options are also viable for patients. When considering cost, accessibility and side effects, these alternative options may be more appealing to some patients, potentially improving adherence compared to pharmaceuticals.

AB  - Four cases of obstructive urolithiasis occurred in male Visayan warty pigs (Sus cebifrons negrinus) during a 12-mo period. One animal died, two were euthanized, and one was treated successfully with a tube cystotomy procedure and a subsequent urinary acidification diet. Uroliths from two cases of urethral obstruction were analyzed and confirmed as calcium carbonate. A fifth nonobstructive case was suspected in an adult female in which calcium carbonate crystalluria was diagnosed, and that case was resolved with medical management. Possible causes of these uroliths included reduced water intake, increased calcium in the diet through use of lucerne hay, and concurrent urinary tract infections. Changes to the diet and access to water were correlated with cessation of further cases, and no recurrence has been seen to date. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first report of calcium carbonate urolithiasis and the first use of a tube cystotomy in a nondomestic pig species.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the activity of vitamin K-dependent gamma-glutamyl carboxylase in patients with calcium oxalate (CaOx) urolithiasis compared with healthy individuals and to assess its relationship to the renal calcium oxalate urolithiasis. METHODS: Renal parenchymas were harvested from urolithic patients and renal tumor patients undergoing nephrectomy. The renal carboxylase activity was evaluated as the radioactivity of [(14)C] labeled sodium bicarbonate in carboxylic reactions in vitro using beta-liquid scintillation counting. RESULTS: Significantly reduced activity of renal vitamin K-dependent gamma-glutamyl carboxylase was observed in the urolithic group as compared with normal controls (P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: It suggests that the reduced carboxylase activity observed in the urolithic patients may play an important role in the course of renal calcium oxalate urolithiasis.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the urolith trace elemental profile and the association of these elements with urolith type and animal variables. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study of 165 goat and 50 pig uroliths collected from urinary bladders from January 1, 1982, through December 31, 2020. Urolith mineral composition was determined using polarized light microscopy and infrared spectroscopy. Trace element analysis was determined by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry. The association between animal variables and trace element content was assessed. The strength of grouping effects of the elements within the uroliths was determined by cluster analysis. RESULTS: Calcium carbonate (74 of 116 [63%]) and apatite (22 of 47 [47%]) were the most commonly identified urolith types in goats and pigs, respectively. The element with the highest concentrations in calcium carbonate uroliths in goats was calcium. Apatite-containing uroliths from pigs had phosphorous as the highest concentration element. Large goat breeds (OR, 1.2; 95% CI, 1.1 to 1.4) and non-pot-bellied pigs had higher odds (OR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.2 to 2.0) of detection of trace elements. The combination of barium, calcium, sodium, and strontium in goats defined the most significant dissimilarity (divergence) within the calcium carbonate uroliths. In pigs, boron, potassium, sodium, and strontium combination defined the most significant dissimilarity within the apatite uroliths. CONCLUSIONS: Trace elements in combinations that defined significant dissimilarity among uroliths suggest an association between trace elements and urolith type. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Trace and macroelements should be analyzed in uroliths and feed to optimize dietary recommendations for urolithiasis prevention.

AB  - Three major conditions control the potential for uric acid stones: the quantitative excretion of uric acid, the volume of urine as it affects the urinary concentration of uric acid and the urinary pH. However, the most important factor for uric acid stone formation is acid urinary pH that is a prerequisite for uric acidic stone formation. Indeed the goal standard of urinary alkalization is to achieve a pH of 6-6.5. Administration of alkali should be titrated appropriately by pH paper to record urinary pH until a steady state is achieved. Alkali therapy such as sodium bicarbonate and potassium citrate has been advocated on the basis of established clinical experience, although potassium citrate should be preferred because it may avoid the complication of calcium salt precipitation. Recently it has been reported the clinical efficacy of therapy with potassium citrate/potassium bicarbonate for dissolution of radiolucent stones respect to control study period (only water daily intake of 1500 ml). Furthermore, mean urinary pH was significantly continuously higher during the alkali treatment study in comparison to the control study period, even though the mean of urinary volumes were similar in the two periods. In conclusion urinary alkalization with maintaining continuously high urinary pH values, could be the treatment of choice for stone dissolution and prevention of uric acid stones.

AB  - Stone disease in patients with spinal cord injury is a source of morbidity and mortality. Previous studies have indicated a decrease in infection-based urolithiasis in recent decades. We aimed to identify changes in stone composition and surgical outcomes in patients with para and quadriplegia over time. A retrospective review of para and quadriplegic patients from 1986 to 2011 who underwent surgical intervention for urolithiasis was performed, identifying 95 patients. The Mantel-Haenszel Chi square test was used to compare change in stone composition over time. The mean patient age was 44.0 years (range 18-88) and treatment included percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) 40 (42.1 %), ureteroscopy 28 (29.5 %), shock wave lithotripsy (SWL) 26 (27.4 %), and nephrectomy 1 (1 %). Overall stone-free status was found in 47.4 % with 19.0 % requiring a repeat procedure. The median hospital stay for patients undergoing SWL was 2.5 days, ureteroscopy 5 days, and PCNL 6 days. Infection-based stone composition was identified in 23 patients (36.5 %). We evaluated the linear change in percent of each stone component over time and identified increasing components of calcium oxalate dihydrate (p = 0.002) and calcium carbonate (p = 0.009). However, over a period of 25 years, the incidence of infection-based stone did not change (p = 0.57). Para and quadriplegic patients with urolithiasis can be difficult to treat surgically with prolonged hospitalizations, low stone-free status, and often require additional procedures. Despite improvements in antibiotic agents and management of neurogenic bladders, infection-based calculi continue to be a significant source of morbidity to this patient population.

AB  - Studies in 24 recurrent oxalate stone-formers have shown that values for urinary calcium excretion for this group on at-home diets vary significantly (P less than 0.001) more than values for creatinine excretions. By placing stone-formers on controlled in-hospital diets and measuring their calcium excretions, we were able to predict probable outpatient hypercalciuria (greater than 7.5 mmol/day) with a sensitivity of 95% and a specificity of 95%. In this study, the renal loss of calcium during low-calcium diets was proportional to the absorptive hypercalciuria during high-calcium diets. Calcium loading experiments in fasted stone-formers and normal subjects indicated that citrate, at citrate:calcium molar ratios ranging from 0.12 to 1, stimulated urinary calcium excretion more than did calcium carbonate loading alone. In addition, citrate also significantly (P less than 0.05) increased the excretion of urinary oxalate by two normal subjects for a given load of calcium oxalate. Malabsorption of citrate and possibly other hydroxycarboxylic acids may thus predispose to oxalate nephrolithiasis by promoting calcium and oxalate absorption.

AB  - We report a new case of silica urolithiasis in a 71-year-old patient with background of medicament ingesta (antacid) which could justify the formation of these calculi with so uncommon composition. Medicament calculi amounts about 1% from total urinary calculi. Among them, silica ones (silicon dioxide or Si O2) have been relate din their etiology to chronical ingest of antacid drugs, specially those with magnesium trisilicate. Silica formation in urine is facilitated and conditioned by an acid pH of it. Diagnosis and therapeutical approach does not change in relation to other lithiasis with similar dimension or location. After its composition report, and ruling out the possibility for patient's malingering, urine alkalinization was applied, with an excellent follow-up afterwards. The antacid was substituted by other drug. We analyze the most important aspects about this case. We also make reference to the main related bibliography.

AB  - Prolonged cell proliferation in response to irritation by calculi may itself evoke malignant transformation of the urothelium. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this process are still unknown. The aim of the present study was to investigate cell cycle regulatory mechanisms in bladder carcinogenesis induced by bladder calculi. Six-week-old Wistar rats were consecutively fed a diet containing 5% terephthalic acid (TPA), 5% TPA plus 4% sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO(3)), 4% NaHCO(3), or basal diet for 48 weeks. Animals were killed at weeks 12, 24, and 48. Treatment with 5% TPA caused high incidences of bladder calculi, preneoplastic lesions, and neoplastic lesions. Immunohistochemical examination revealed overexpression of cyclin D1, cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (Cdk4), retinoblastoma (Rb), and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) in bladder preneoplastic and neoplastic lesions. In contrast, p16 expression was reduced or absent. These results were confirmed by immunoblotting analysis. Quantitation of mRNA by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) showed a significant increase in cyclin D1 and PCNA mRNA in tumor cells. None of the 16 transitional cell carcinomas (TCCs) had ras mutations as examined by PCR-single strand conformational polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) analysis. These results suggested that deregulation of p16-cyclin D1/Cdk4-Rb pathway, but not oncogenic activation of ras, plays a crucial role in bladder tumorigenesis induced by bladder calculi.

AB  - The effect of terephthalic acid (TPA) on urinary bladder carcinogenesis was examined. Male Wistar rats were initiated by injection of N-Methyl-N-Nitrosourea (MNU) (20 mg/kg b.w. ip) twice a week for 4 weeks, then given basal diet containing 5% TPA, 5% TPA plus 4% Sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) or 1% TPA for the next 22 weeks, and then euthanized. 5% TPA treatment induced a high incidence of urinary bladder calculi and a large amount of precipitate. Though 5% TPA plus 4% Sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) and 1% TPA treatment did not induce urinary bladder calculi formation, they resulted in a moderate increase in urinary precipitate. Histological examination of urinary bladder revealed that MNU-5% TPA treatment resulted in a higher incidence of simple hyperplasia, papillary or nodular hyperplasia (PN hyperplasia), papilloma and cancer than MNU control. MNU-5% TPA plus 4% Sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) and 1% TPA treatment increased slightly the incidence of simple hyperplasia and PN hyperplasia (not statistically significant). The major elements of the precipitate are phosphorus, potassium, sulfur, chloride, calcium and TPA. The present study indicated that the calculi induced by TPA had a strong promoting activity on urinary bladder carcinogenesis and the precipitate containing calcium terephthalate (CaTPA) may also have weak promoting activity on urinary bladder carcinogenesis.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This paper provides a brief history of the publication of calcified biological objects and presents one that was present in the grave associated with a mature adult female buried in the South Tombs Cemetery at Amarna, Egypt (c. 1353-1332BCE). METHODS: Macroscopic examination revealed an ovoid object constructed of concentric layers of a coarse sand-like material oriented around a dense core that lacked evidence of parasites. Microscopic examination revealed the object is composed of densely, yet haphazardly packed, elongated octahedron shaped crystals with no evidence of cellular structures. Basic chemical analysis eliminated calcium carbonate as a constituent material. RESULTS: Based on comparison with previously published examples from the archaeological and clinical literature and careful differential diagnosis, it is suggested this object is a bladder stone. SIGNIFICANCE: A brief discussion of the implications of bladder stones on individual health and broader epidemiological constraints to illustrate the depth such discoveries can bring to our understanding of ancient lived experience concludes the work. LIMITATIONS: The burial of Ind. 286 was disturbed. The identification of a bladder stone presumes the stone would have been found within the pelvic cavity, which cannot be confirmed. Other graves in the vicinity of this grave were also disturbed. It is unlikely, but still possible, that the stone originated from another grave and was relocated to this grave after disturbance. Full chemical analysis was not possible. SUGGESTIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH: Radiographic and chemical analysis would provide more information to strengthen the certainty of the differential diagnosis.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Urinary bladder hyperplasia associated with terephthalic acid (TPA) treatment was examined with concomitant use of sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) or hydrochlorothiazide to allow assessment of the relationship among bladder stones, epithelial hyperplasia, and corresponding cell cycle checkpoint gene expression in Sprague-Dawley (SD) rat. METHODS: A total of 112 weanling male SD rats that divided between six groups were given basal diet (control), diets containing 5% TPA or in combination with either 4% sodium NaHCO3 or 0.02% hydrochlorothiazide. After 90-day feeding, bladder samples were collected for histopathological diagnoses, and immunohistochemical method was used to characterize the expression of p16Ink4a cyclin D1, CDK4, EGFr and cyclin E in relation to that of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). RESULTS: In TPA treatment groups, bladder stone incidence was 40% (21/52) with 14 cases of proliferative bladder. In control and other groups, neither stone nor epithelial cell proliferation was diagnosed. PCNA-positive focal hyperplasic lesions involved all epithelial layers. Overexpressions of cyclin D1, CDK4, EGFr are found in the corresponding lesion. p16Ink4a nuclear staining reduced in proliferative bladders especially with a great quantity of stone. In addition, no positive expression was detected on cyclin E. CONCLUSION: The present study provides a strong evidence of a link between induction of bladder hyperplasia, deregulation of the p16Ink4a-cyclin D1/CDK4 pathway, and abnormal EGFr mediated signal transduction pathway.

AB  - Bilateral nephrolithiasis with a concurrent vaginal calculus was identified in a stranded free-ranging long-beaked common dolphin Delphinus capensis. Necropsy and radiologic examinations of the sexually mature D. capensis revealed multiple small irregularly round nephroliths and a 6.4 x 4.1 x 9.2 cm vaginal calculus weighing 182 g. Nephroliths numbered 68 and 71 in the left and right kidneys, respectively, and ranged from 1.7 to 6.9 mm in diameter. Nephroliths were composed of 100% ammonium urate, which has been found in captive dolphin populations. However, the vaginolith consisted of struvite and calcium carbonate suggesting an alternate etiology. The composition of the vaginolith suggests that bacterial vaginitis could have served as the predisposing condition. Renal lesions included chronic tubulointerstitial nephritis with tubular degeneration and loss, likely secondary to the nephroliths. The pathogenesis of ammonium urate nephrolithiasis in managed care is suspected to be linked to diet and age but in this case may be due to metabolic disruption. However, if environmental changes cause a shift in prey species, the risk of nephrolithiasis in free-ranging cetaceans could increase. Careful surveillance for nephroliths in free-ranging populations should be considered by researchers.

AB  - Drug-induced calculi are often mis-diagnosed because of inadequate analysis of the urinary calculi. These stones can only be characterized unambiguously by global physical methods like infra-red spectrophotometry. From a series of 2,000 calculi analysed under infra-red, we identified 22, i.e. 1.1% of cases, which contained, partly or entirely, drug products. Ten other cases are still being studied. Amongst the products identified we found metabolites of glafenine (Glifanan) in 7 cases, triamterene and its derivatives (Cycloteriam) in 7 cases, metabolites of phenazopyridine (Pyridium) in 4 cases, sulphonamides in 2 cases : N-acetylsulphamethoxazole hydrochloride (Bactrim) and N-acetylsulphaguanidine (Guanidan), flumequine (Apurone) in 1 case and calcite (Cal-Mag-Na) in 1 case. The authors estimate that about 100,000 calculi are excreted in France each year and that at least 1,000 of these potentially contain drugs and are not diagnosed. Early recognition of drug induced stones is essential in order to protect the patient from recurrences, the risks of renal complications or, more simply, from useless therapeutic or dietetic regimes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Kidney stones are a highly prevalent disease worldwide. Additionally, both environmental and occupational exposure to Pb and Cd continue to be prevalent globally and can result in renal toxicity. The objective of this study was to examine the potential presence of Pb and Cd in kidney stones, and to assess for correlation with demographic factors including smoking, gender, age, and kidney stone matrix composition. METHODS: Patient kidney stones (n = 96) were analyzed using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy to identify the stone constituents. Cd and Pb concentrations (microg/g) were determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Cd and Pb concentrations were correlated using bivariable and multivariable statistical analysis with demographic factors (age, gender, smoking status), and kidney stone composition. RESULTS: Kidney stone Cd (median 0.092 microg/g, range 0.014 to 2.46) and Pb concentrations (median 0.95 microg/g, range 0.060 to 15.4) were moderately correlated (r = 0.56, P < 0.0001). Cd concentrations were positively associated with patient history of smoking, patient age, and calcium oxalate monohydrate levels while negatively associated with struvite and uric acid/uric acid dihydrate. Pb concentrations were positively associated with females and apatite levels while negatively associated with uric acid/uric acid dihydrate. After holding constant other stone type composition levels, smoking status, and age, both Pb and Cd were positively associated with apatite and negatively associated with uric acid/uric acid dihydrate, struvite, and calcium carbonate. CONCLUSIONS: Cd and Pb kidney stone concentrations are associated with specific kidney stone types. Cd and Pb kidney stone concentrations are both associated with smoking.

AB  - Persistent hypercalcemia attributable to parathyroid gland hyperplasia was identified in 6 dogs with primary hyperparathyroidism. Clinical signs included polydipsia (n = 4), polyuria (n = 4), and signs caused by cystic calculi (n = 3). Abnormal clinical pathologic findings included hypercalcemia (mean, 13.6 mg/dl; range, 12.6 to 14.7 mg/dl; n = 6), hypophosphatemia (mean, 2.2 mg/dl; range, 1.4 to 2.9 mg/dl; n = 6), high serum alkaline phosphatase activity (mean, 222 IU/L; range, 161 to 286 IU/L; n = 3), and isosthenuria (mean, 1.012; range, 1.006 to 1.017; n = 6). Serum parathyroid hormone concentration was within the reference range or high (mean, 23 pmol/L; range, 7 to 119 pmol/L; reference range, 1.5 to 13 pmol/L) in all dogs. At surgery, the number of large parathyroid glands was variable, being limited to 1 gland in 3 dogs, 2 glands in 2 dogs, and 4 glands in 1 dog. All visibly large parathyroid glands were surgically removed from each dog. Serum calcium concentration decreased into or below the reference range within 72 hours of surgery in all dogs, confirming the diagnosis of primary parathyroid disease. Multiple nodules of adenomatous hyperplasia were identified in each dog. All 6 dogs were treated with vitamin D and calcium carbonate following surgery. The dog from which all 4 parathyroid glands were removed has remained eucalcemic for more than 1 year with vitamin D supplementation. Vitamin D and calcium administration was discontinued within 4 to 12 weeks of surgery in the remaining 5 dogs. These dogs remained eucalcemic without vitamin D supplementation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

AB  - The secondary constituents accompanying calcite and vaterite (crystalline forms of calcium carbonate) in the sabulous deposits from 140 vesical samples and one renal sample of equine urine were studied by infrared spectroscopy (IR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX). Apatitic calcium phosphate, present in 12 per cent of the samples, generally appeared in the form of spherulites with smooth and rough surfaces. Calcium sulphate, clearly detected by IR in 12.7 per cent of the samples, did not have a characteristic structure under SEM, although EDX detected sulphur in the samples. Amorphous silica was observed in one case and had a nodular appearance. Organic fibres were not as common as might have been expected in equine urinary deposits.

AB  - Atomic spectrometry has been used in 20 samples of equine urinary sabulous deposits in order to detect minor elements accompanying the predominant element, calcium, which is present in the form of calcium carbonate (calcite and/or vaterite). The elements measured have been (besides calcium) magnesium, sodium, potassium, iron, copper and manganese. Phosphates, sulphates and silica are frequently present as minor constituents of equine urinary sabulous deposits and uroliths, but their detection can be difficult by infrared (IR) spectroscopy in the original samples due to overlapping with the bands of calcium carbonate. For that reason, the calcination residues of six urinary calculi and 33 samples of sabulous material have been studied by IR spectroscopy and energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis. The results confirm the presence of the above mentioned minor constituents in most samples studied.

AB  - Although calcium supplementation can cause hypercalciuria, the risk of nephrolithiasis has been shown to decrease rather than increase among subjects who had a higher calcium intake. Hypercalciuria is also a well-established side effect of calcitriol administration. However, the risk of nephrolithiasis is not well defined. The present study was undertaken to prospectively determine the effect of calcium with or without calcitriol on physicochemical risk factors associated with calcium oxalate nephrolithiasis in Thai postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. Subjects consisted of 53 Thai women more than 10 years postmenopausal who were randomly allocated to receive 750 mg of calcium carbonate supplement alone (n = 28) or 750 mg of calcium carbonate plus 0.5 microg calcitriol (n = 25) daily. Mean +/- SEM for age was 65.3+/-1.1 years, body weight 53.5+/-1.3 kg. Urine samples for biochemical assays were collected at baseline and 3 months after treatment. Supersaturation for calcium oxalate stone formation was assessed from the 24 h urine constituents by the Tiselius's index, AP(CaOx). Three months of calcium supplement alone resulted in a modest, but not significant, increase in urinary calcium (baseline, 2.90+/-0.43 mmol/day; after treatment 3.58+/-0.54 mmol/day) with no change in urinary oxalate, citrate or magnesium. In contrast, calcium together with calcitriol caused a significant increase in urinary calcium (baseline, 2.87+/-0.41 mmol/day; after treatment, 4.08+/-0.57 mmol/day; p < 0.05). No significant change in other urine constituents after treatment with calcium and calcitriol was detected. Therefore, AP(CaOx) did not significantly increase either after calcium alone (baseline, 1.17+/-0.39; after treatment, 1.36+/-0.28) or after calcium plus calcitriol (baseline, 1.09+/-0.17; after treatment, 1.09+/-0.19). However, after treatments, 12 subjects (23%)--6 receiving calcium supplement alone and 6 receiving calcium plus calcitriol supplement--had high AP(CaOx) values (greater than the upper limit of 95% Cl for AP(CaOx) derived from non-stone-forming Thai women). The post-treatment/baseline ratio was 3.21+/-0.74 for urinary calcium, 1.01+/-0.19 for urinary oxalate, and 2.23+/-0.42 (median 1.15) for AP(CaOx). The post-treatment/baseline ratio of calcium, but not for urinary oxalate, had a significant correlation with the post-treatment/baseline ratio of AP(CaOx). Our findings suggest that the alteration in the risk of calcium oxalate nephrolithiasis based on urinary composition is related to the alteration in urinary calcium. The risk of calcium oxalate nephrolithiasis does not increase significantly after calcium or combined calcium and calcitriol supplement in the majority of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent studies showed that postmenopausal women lost less bone mass when supplemented with calcium or estrogen therapy. However, the safety of the treatments in terms of the risk of calcium oxalate stone formation is unknown. We therefore conducted this study to determine the alteration in calcium oxalate supersaturation after calcium supplement or after combined calcium and estrogen therapy in postmenopausal osteoporotic women. METHODS: Fifty-six postmenopausal women were enrolled in this study. All subjects were more than 10 years postmenopausal with vertebral or femoral osteoporosis by bone mineral density criteria. They were randomly allocated to receive either 625 mg of calcium carbonate (250 mg of elemental calcium) at the end of a meal three times a day (group A, n=26) or calcium carbonate in the same manner plus 0.625 mg/day of conjugated equine estrogen and 5 mg medrogestone acetate from day 1-12 each month (group B, n=30). The age (mean +/- S.E.M.) was 66.3 +/- 1.2 and 65.1 +/- 1.1 years, weight 54.1 +/- 1.2 and 55.3 +/- 2.1 kg, in group A and group B, respectively. Urine specimens (24-h) were collected at baseline and 3 months after treatment for the determination of calcium oxalate saturation by using Tiselius's index (AP(CaOx)) and calcium/citrate ratio. RESULTS: After 3 months of treatment, there was no significant alteration from baseline for urinary excretion of calcium, citrate and oxalate. Urinary phosphate excretion was significantly reduced (6.3 +/- 0.7 vs. 5.1 +/- 0.7 mmol/day for group A and 8.2 +/- 0.9 vs. 5.8 +/- 0.7 mmol/day for group B, P<0.05), whereas net alkaline absorption was significantly elevated (10.1 +/- 3.6 vs. 20.1 +/- 4.4 meq/day for group A and 4.8 +/- 3.2 vs. 19.9 +/- 3.6 meq/day for group B, P<0.05). Calcium/citrate ratio and AP(CaOx) determined at baseline were not different from the corresponding values after treatment in both groups; calcium/citrate: 10.1 +/- 3.1 vs. 10.1 +/- 2.5 for group A and 9.3 +/- 1.8 vs. 11.9 +/- 2.5 for group B and AP(CaOx): 1.1 +/- 0.1 vs. 1.3 +/- 0.2 for group A and 1.2 +/- 0.2 vs. 1.1 +/- 0.1 for group B. There were eight and nine patients with high AP(CaOx), or >2, at baseline and after treatment, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Calcium supplement with a meal or combined calcium supplement and estrogen therapy is not associated with a significant increased risk of calcium oxalate stone formation in the majority of postmenopausal osteoporotic patients. Determination of urinary saturation for calcium oxalate after calcium and estrogen supplements, especially at the initial phase of treatment, may be helpful in the avoidance of nephrolithiasis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Variation in the timing of calcium supplement may affect gastrointestinal absorption of both calcium and oxalate differently and may associate with variable risk of calcium oxalate nephrolithiasis. There are few human studies addressing specifically the appropriate time for taking calcium supplement. Therefore, this study was performed to compare calcium bioavailability and the risk of calcium oxalate stone formation for calcium supplement taken with meal vs. taken at bedtime. METHODS: Thirty-two healthy male navy privates, 22.7 +/- 1.9 years old (mean +/- SD), who had normal renal function (serum creatinine less than 150 umol/L) and no history of renal stone, participated in the study. The subjects were randomly allocated into two groups of 16 each. Group A took 1 g of calcium carbonate with meal, 3 times/day; and group B took 3 g/day of calcium carbonate at bedtime. After taking the regimens for 1 week, followed by 1 month of washout period, crossover between both groups was done. The diet was controlled throughout the study. Twenty-four-hour urine collections for the determination of urinary constituents were obtained at baseline and after taking both regimens of calcium supplement. Activity product for calcium oxalate was determined to assess the risk of calcium oxalate stone formation. RESULTS: Urinary excretions of calcium were significantly elevated above the baseline values when taking calcium supplement both with meal (3.48 +/- 2.13 mmol/day vs. 5.17 +/- 2.61 mmol/day, P < 0.05) and at bedtime (3.09 +/- 1.70 mmol/day vs. 5.08 +/- 2.34 mmol/day, P < 0.05). There was no difference between the two regimens in the urinary calcium excretions. The urinary oxalate was decreased significantly when the subjects took calcium supplement with meal compared with the corresponding baseline value (0.13 +/- 0.05 vs. 0.17 +/- 0.07 mmol/d, P= 0.01). In contrast, there was no alteration in urinary oxalate when calcium supplement was taken at bedtime compared to the baseline values (0.15 +/- 0.05 mmol/day vs. 0.15 +/- 0.06 mmol/day, P= 0.9). Compared with the corresponding baseline values, there was no significant increase in the activity product for calcium oxalate when taking calcium with meal (0.54 +/- 0.25 vs. 0.57 +/- 0.22, P= 0.54), but it was increased significantly when calcium supplement was taken at bedtime (0.47 +/- 0.21 vs. 0.72 +/- 0.27, P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Calcium supplement should be taken with meal in order to avoid increasing the risk of calcium oxalate nephrolithiasis.

AB  - The urine to blood carbon dioxide tension gradient (U-B PCO2) following alkalinization of the urine (pH = 7.8) has been widely used to assess distal tubular hydrogen secretion. The magnitude of the U-B PCO2 is influenced not only by the rate of hydrogen secretion but also by bicarbonate concentration and water abstraction. Simultaneous administration of sodium bicarbonate and dDAVP improve the reliability of the test in healthy children. Children with distal renal tubular acidosis were not able to increase urinary PCO2, while a normal increase was found in patients with proximal renal tubular acidosis and the Fanconi Syndrome. Four out of nine patients with urolithiasis failed to increase urinary PCO2 following NaHCO3 and dDAVP-administration, despite a normal ability to acidify the urine following NH4Cl administration. To assess the effect of acute alterations in urinary concentration on urinary PCO2, the test was carried out in children with central diabetes insipidus. Despite sharp increase in urinary bicarbonate concentration these patients failed to increase urinary PCO2.

AB  - Calcium oxalate stone formation occurs under pathological conditions and accounts for more than 80% of all types of kidney stones. In the current study, we show for the first time that calcium oxalate stones are formed in the mouse inner ear of a genetic model for hearing loss and vestibular dysfunction in humans. The vestibular system within the inner ear is dependent on extracellular tiny calcium carbonate minerals for proper function. Thousands of these biominerals, known as otoconia, are associated with the utricle and saccule sensory maculae and are vital for mechanical stimulation of the sensory hair cells. We show that a missense mutation within the Slc26a4 gene abolishes the transport activity of its encoded protein, pendrin. As a consequence, dramatic changes in mineral composition, size, and shape occur within the utricle and saccule in a differential manner. Although abnormal giant carbonate minerals reside in the utricle at all ages, in the saccule, a gradual change in mineral composition leads to a formation of calcium oxalate in adult mice. By combining imaging and spectroscopy tools, we determined the profile of mineral composition and morphology at different time points. We propose a novel mechanism for the accumulation and aggregation of oxalate crystals in the inner ear.

AB  - The association of a critical reduction in renal mass with the subsequent destruction of remaining nephrons has been observed in several species. We studied this process in experimental rabbits after 1 2/3 nephrectomy to define the course and its pathogenesis in this species. Control rabbits underwent sham operative procedures. After renal ablation, rabbits became increasingly cachectic and developed polyuria and hypertension. Despite food intake similar to that of controls (grams per kilogram per day), experimental rabbits developed severe hypercalcemia by 5 to 8 weeks after renal ablation, a change that persisted until death. During the study 17 experimental animals died of uremia 9 to 27 weeks after surgery, and the remaining seven experimental and 25 sham-operated rabbits were sacrificed at 5 to 7 months. At death, 19/24 experimental rabbits had severe obstruction of their collecting systems by concretions of gravel (n = 3) or large calcium carbonate stones (n = 16). Renal biopsy at 4 weeks revealed focal interstitial round cell infiltration progressing by 12 weeks to diffuse tubulointerstitial inflammation and fibrosis. Histologic evidence of obstruction was also evident at this time and became extensive on all subsequent examinations. By contrast, the glomeruli remained well preserved without evidence of sclerosis. We speculate that chronic hypercalcemia and, perhaps more significantly, urinary obstruction may have altered intrarenal hemodynamics and prevented the development of progressive sclerosis observed in the rat remnant kidney model. The present study describes an experimental model of chronic hypercalcemia and spontaneous calcium carbonate nephrolithiasis.

AB  - We report an uncommon case of a 38-year-old woman who admitted for bladder lithiasis undergoing repeated surgical management and being apparently recurrent. The intravenous pyelography and retrograde urethrocystography clear the urinary tract. Biologic evaluation eliminates any metabolic or endocrine cause. The confirmation of a factitious origin is given by fluorescence X analysis of the extracted stones which conclude to calcium carbonate structure and psychiatric care. The self-intromission of these calculi into the bladder is due to the personality disorder being in the frame of Munchausen's syndrome. Two years later, no recurrence is noted and an excellent psychiatric care is achieved.

AB  - Better endoscopic vision is mandatory for successful ureteroscopic stone operations to achieve shorter operating time. However, an important impairing factor for a good endoscopic view is the cloudiness of vision which was formed during laser fragmentation. Holmium laser fragmentation of calcium oxalate stones produces calcium carbonate solubility of which is dependent on pH, citrate, and phosphate. In this ex vivo research, the solubility of calcium carbonate has been investigated in solutions composed of various concentrations of citrate and phosphate buffered at different pH levels after laser fragmentation of calcium oxalate stones. Calcium oxalate stones were placed into the laboratory tubes filled with various concentrations of citrate-phosphate buffers with different pH values. Laser energy in dusting mode was applied to the stones and spectrophotometric measurement for optical density (OD) was calculated for each buffered solution for clarity comparison. In the first phase, solutions composed of four different molar concentrations of citrate-phosphate buffer (0.2, 0.3, 0.4 and 0.5 molars) at various pH levels were used. Then, the next phase of the study was designed to compare solutions demonstrating the lowest OD values with an isotonic saline solution. The results were most convenient at 0.5 molarity (pH = 6) followed by 0.4 molarity (pH = 7) in the first phase (OD values of 0.054 and 0.065, respectively). In the next phase, OD values of both buffered solutions were significantly lower than those of isotonic saline solution (p = 0). Two specific buffers have provided better optic visibility values after laser fragmentation supporting their use as an irrigation solution for the favor of less cloudiness.

AB  - Primary Sjogren's syndrome (SS) is characterized by an inflammatory process in the salivary and lacrimal glands, but the kidneys may also be involved. Renal tubular functions were studied in 27 patients with SS, all females, age 37-78. Both SS-patients with and without known distal renal tubular acidosis (dRTA) were included, dRTA was found in 18/27 (67%), impaired urine concentrating ability in 13/27 (48%). Hypocitraturia was identified in 20/27 (74%) and reduced tubular reabsorption of phosphate (TRP%) in 18/27 (67%). Tubular proteinuria (alpha 1-mikroglobulin) was present in 11/24 (46%), and tubular enzymuria (NAG) in 7/24 (29%). Hypocitraturia and/or dRTA were found in all patients with any kind of abnormal renal tubular function test. All except one of the patients with dRTA not treated with sodium bicarbonate had hypocitraturia. We conclude that distal tubular dysfunction was common in our SS-patients, but a concommitant proximal dysfunction was also seen. Determination of urinary citrate represents a valuable test for detection of renal disease in SS.

AB  - 63 patients with hypocitraturia (44.9% of the total) and 33 patients with hypomagnesiuria (24.8% of the total) received oral magnesium hydroxide and/or Na/K citrate in addition to other therapeutic agents if indicated and a common-sense diet. Hypocitraturic patients were categorized into 3 groups and received 27-81 mEq/day oral citrate according to the deficiency grade. Hypomagnesiuric patients also formed two groups according to the deficiency grade and received 500 and 1,000 mg/day magnesium hydroxide, respectively. Replacement was intermittant and was controlled every 3 months until reaching normal values. We evaluated 28 of 63 hypocitraturic and 15 of 33 hypomagnesiuric patients who had inhibitory deficiency as the sole causal factor of their urolithiasis. After a follow-up of 13.5 +/- 10.2 months, no patient in either group developed a new stone. Citrate and magnesium were increased significantly in the respective groups; calcium and oxalate excretion was lowered, and urine pH and volume increased significantly. A deficiency grade-adjusted and intermittant replacement therapy with Mg and citrate is very effective, has less side effects and ensures good patients compliance.

AB  - We examined the effectiveness of chlorthalidone or magnesium hydroxide in the prevention of recurrent calcium oxalate kidney calculi. In a double-blind random allocation design daily dosages of 25 or 50 mg. chlorthalidone, 650 or 1,300 mg. magnesium hydroxide, or an identical placebo were administered. All groups showed significantly decreased calculous events compared to the pretreatment rates. During the trial 56.1 per cent fewer calculi than predicted developed in the placebo group (p less than 0.01), whereas the groups receiving low and high dosage magnesium hydroxide showed 73.9 and 62.3 per cent fewer calculi, respectively (p less than 0.001 and less than 0.01, respectively). Chlorthalidone treatment resulted in a 90.1 per cent decrease from predicted rates and both dosages yielded similar results. When the treatments were compared chlorthalidone was significantly better than the placebo or magnesium hydroxide (p less than 0.01). The large decreases in calculous events seen when placebo or ineffective therapy was given underscore the positive treatment bias that occurs when historical controls are used and they demonstrate the need for proper experimental design.

AB  - Patients with ileostomy typically have recurrent renal stones and produce scanty, acidic, sodium-poor urine because of abnormally large enteric losses of water and sodium bicarbonate. Here we used a combination of intra-operative digital photography and biopsy of the renal papilla and cortex to measure changes associated with stone formation in seven patients with ileostomy. Papillary deformity was present in four patients and was associated with decreased estimated glomerular filtration rates. All patients had interstitial apatite plaque, as predicted from their generally acid, low-volume urine. Two patients had stones attached to plaque; however, all patients had crystal deposits that plugged the ducts of Bellini and inner medullary collecting ducts (IMCDs). Despite acid urine, all crystal deposits contained apatite, and five patients had deposits of sodium and ammonium acid urates. Stones were either uric acid or calcium oxalate as predicted by supersaturation, however, there was a general lack of supersaturation for calcium phosphate as brushite, sodium, or ammonium acid urate because of the overall low urine pH. This suggests that local tubular pH exceeds that of bulk urine. Despite low urine pH, patients with an ileostomy resemble those with obesity bypass, in whom IMCD apatite crystal plugs are found. They are, however, unlike these bypass patients in having interstitial apatite plaque. IMCD plugging with sodium and ammonium acid urate has not been found previously and appears to correlate with formation of uric acid stones.

Calcinosis cutis is an acquired disorder of calcium deposition in cutaneous tissues that occurs as one of the following forms: dystrophic, metastatic, idiopathic, and iatrogenic. We report a case of a woman with PXE who developed widespread dystrophic calcinosis cutis in areas affected by PXE. Although tumoral calcification and nephrolithiasis have been reported in patients with PXE, only one other case in the English-language literature of PXE and calcinosis cutis has been reported and this case was characterized by small, milia-like papules on the front of the neck, without significant discomfort, whereas our patient had widespread involvement that was very painful and pruritic. On 6-month follow-up, this patient had only mild improvement after treatment with an anti-itch lotion and aluminum hydroxide, with which she was noncompliant.

AB  - Thirty-one calcium stone patients were treated with 300 mg allopurinol daily during a mean follow-up period of 2 years. They were also given advice on diet and fluid intake. The effects on the recurrence rate of stones were compared with the effects on the recurrence rate in 43 calcium stone patients who were given similar advice on diet and fluid intake but were not treated with allopurinol. In both groups there was a reduction in the recurrence rate but no difference between patients treated with allopurinol and the control group. Some patients with only hyperuricosuria prior to treatment seemed to benefit from allopurinol treatment, whereas those with hypercalciuria continued to form stones with the same frequency. Allopurinol treatment in calcium stone disease appears less effective than treatment with thiazides, magnesium hydroxide or orthophosphate.

AB  - Uric acid stones occur in 10% of all kidney stones and are the second most-common cause of urinary stones after calcium oxalate and calcium phosphate calculi. The most important risk factor for uric acid crystallization and stone formation is a low urine pH (below 5.5) rather than an increased urinary uric acid excretion. Main causes of low urine pH are tubular disorders (including gout), chronic diarrhea or severe dehydration. Uric acid stone disease can be prevented and these are one of the few urinary tract stones that can be dissolved successfully. The treatment of uric acid stones consists not only of hydration (urine volume above 2000 ml daily), but mainly of urine alkalinization to pH values between 6.2 and 6.8. Urinary alkalization with potassium citrate or sodium bicarbonate is a highly effective treatment, resulting in dissolution of existing stones. Urinary uric acid excretion can be reduced by a low-purine diet. Potassium citrate is the treatment of choice for the prevention of recurrence of uric acid calculi. Allopurinol reduces the frequency of stone formation in hyperuricosuric patients with recurrent uric acid stones and/or gout.

AB  - Metabolic evaluation of stone-forming (SF) patients is based on the determination of calcium, oxalate, citrate, uric acid and other parameters in 24-h urine samples under a random diet. A reliable measurement of urinary oxalate requires the collection of urine in a receptacle containing acid preservative. However, urinary uric acid cannot be determined in the same sample under this condition. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that the addition of preservatives (acid or alkali) after urine collection would not modify the results of those lithogenic parameters. Thirty-four healthy subjects (HS) were submitted to two non-consecutive collections of 24-h urine. The first sample was collected in a receptacle containing hydrochloric acid (HCl 6 N) and the second in a dry plastic container, with HCl being added as soon as the urine sample was received at the laboratory. Additionally, 34 HS and 34 SF patients collected a spot urine sample that was divided into four aliquots, one containing HCl, another containing sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO(3 )5 g/l), and two others in which these two preservative agents were added 24 h later. Urinary oxalate, calcium, magnesium, citrate, creatinine and uric acid were determined. Urinary parameters were also evaluated in the presence of calcium oxalate or uric acid crystals. Mean values of all urinary parameters obtained from previously acidified 24-h urine samples did not differ from those where acid was added after urine collection. The same was true for spot urine samples, with the exception of urinary citrate that presented a slight albeit significant change of 5.9% between samples in HS and 3.1% in SF. Uric acid was also not different between pre- and post-alkalinized spot urine samples. The presence of crystals did not alter these results. We concluded that post-delivery acidification or alkalinization of urine samples does not modify the measured levels of urinary oxalate, calcium, magnesium, creatinine and uric acid, and that the change on citrate was not relevant, hence allowing all parameters to be determined in a single urine sample, thus avoiding the inconvenience and cost of multiple 24-h urine sample collections.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Struvite stones account for 15% of urinary calculi and are typically associated with urease-producing urinary tract infections and carry significant morbidity. This study aims to characterize struvite stones based on purity of stone composition, bacterial speciation, risk factors, and clinical features. METHODS: Retrospective data was collected from patients diagnosed with infection stones between 2008 and 2012. Stone analysis, perioperative urine cultures, bacterial speciation, and clinical data were collected and analyzed. The purity of struvite stones was determined. Statistical comparisons were made among homogeneous and heterogeneous struvite stones. RESULTS: From the four participating centres, 121 struvite stones were identified. Only 13.2% (16/121) were homogenous struvite. Other components included calcium phosphate (42.1%), calcium oxalate (33.9%), calcium carbonate (27.3%), and uric acid (5.8%). Partial or full staghorn calculi occurred in 23.7% of cases. Urease-producing bacteria were only present in 30% of cases. Proteus, E. coli, and Enterococcus were the most common bacterial isolates from perioperative urine, and percutaneous nephrolithotomy was the most common modality of treatment. Only 40% of patients had a urinalysis that was nitrite-positive, indicating that urinalysis alone is not reliable for diagnosing infection stones. The study's limitation is its retrospective nature; as such, the optimal timing of cultures with respect to stone analysis or treatment was not always possible, urine cultures were often not congruent with stone cultures in the same patient, and our findings of E. coli commonly cultured does not suggest causation. CONCLUSIONS: Struvite stones are most often heterogeneous in composition. Proteus remains a common bacterial isolate; however, E. coli and Enterococcus were also frequently identified. This new data provides evidence that patients with struvite stones can have urinary tract pathogens other than urease-producing bacteria, thus challenging previous conventional dogma.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess the results of jejunal conduit urinary diversion, with particular attention to electrolyte imbalance and long-term renal function. METHODS: From 1976 to 1994, 50 patients underwent urinary diversion using a short jejunal loop (10 to 12 cm) placed transperitoneally. Of these patients, 18 received pelvic irradiation before diversion. Renal function and configuration of the upper urinary tract were assessed by creatinine clearance and excretory urography. RESULTS: Median follow-up was 26 months (3 to 204). Of 50 patients, 22 had a follow-up more than 5 years later (median 86 months). Eight patients (16%) underwent 10 revision procedures postoperatively. Late complications related to urinary diversion included renal calculi (12%), parastomal hernia (6%), pyelonephritis (4%), ureterojejunal obstruction (4%), and stomal prolapse (2%). Electrolyte imbalance occurred in 2 patients (4%) and was easily corrected by 4 g sodium bicarbonate. No significant decrease in creatinine clearance (P = 0.6) was found in 22 patients with a follow-up of more than 5 years; however, of these patients, 2 had a decrease in creatinine clearance of greater than 20%, due to ureterojejunal obstruction. Of 42 ureterorenal units, hydronephrosis occurred and increased in 1 and 2 cases, respectively, and renal scarring occurred and progressed in 2 and 2 cases, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Urinary diversion using a short length of jejunum placed transperitoneally is a reliable procedure and gives good long-term renal function. Electrolyte imbalances are rare. Moreover, jejunal conduit can be used in almost all situations, especially after pelvic irradiation.

AB  - Potassium bicarbonate (KBC) potently reduces urine calcium excretion in adult humans, including patients with hypertension or calcium urolithiasis, and postmenopausal women. In the latter, who have substantial risk of calcium deficiency, it remains unknown whether the observed short-term urine calcium-lowering effect of KBC persists over years. We studied 170 postmenopausal women randomized to KBC 30, 60, or 90 mmol/d (KBC treatment), or placebo, for up to 36 months. Each received a multivitamin with 400 IU vitamin D, and calcium carbonate as needed to produce a total dietary calcium intake of at least 30 mmol daily. Daily urine calcium excretion (UCaV) did not differ among groups at baseline (all-groups mean +/- SD, 155 +/- 83 mg/d). From 1-36 months of KBC treatment, adjusting UCaV for creatinine (Cr) excretion, each dose of KBC reduced UCaV (P < 0.01) with a dose-dependent trend (P = 0.05). The reduced UCaV/Cr persisted throughout the KBC treatment period (up to 36 months) in all KBC, and the greatest reductions occurred in the subjects with greatest baseline UCaV/Cr (Delta UCaV/Cr vs. baseline UCaV/Cr; P < 0.001). Twenty-eight percent of the subjects had high baseline calciuria (UCaV/Cr > 200 mg Ca/1000 mg Cr). With baseline UCaV/Cr of 250 mg/1000 mg Cr, KBC 60 mmol decreased UCaV/Cr by 55.8 mg/1000 mg Cr, a potential daily calcium retention that over a 36-month period would accumulate up to 55,845 mg of calcium, nearly 5% of bone calcium content. KBC treatment induced a dose-dependent decrease in UCaV/Cr that persisted up to 36 months, with the greatest decreases occurring in those women with the greatest baseline UCaV, nearly a third of whom had high baseline calciuria. Thus, one can preselect postmenopausal women most likely to have the urine calcium-lowering effect of KBC and predict their potential bone calcium increase.

AB  - RATIONALE: Hypophosphatasia is an inborn error of metabolism that can appear any time in life, mainly with bone manifestations due to low alkaline phosphatase activity. Asfotase alfa is a specific enzyme reposition treatment that has shown promising results in children; however, there are few reports about the outcomes in adult patients. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 36-year-old male presented with an early history of craniosynostosis, short stature, and multiple fractures since the age of 13 years-which needed numerous surgical corrections. He was admitted with a previous diagnosis of osteogenesis imperfecta, taking alendronate, calcium carbonate, cholecalciferol, and calcitriol. Bone mineral density was low (lumbar spine Z-score = -3.0 SD), with impairment of all parameters of high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT). Kidney impairment was also observed with reduced creatinine clearance, nephrolithiasis, and nephrocalcinosis. DIAGNOSIS: Alkaline phosphatase was unexpectedly low (6 U/L, reference value: 30-120 U/L), with high serum vitamin B6 (260 mcg/L, reference value: 5.2-34.1). Genetic testing showed a homozygous missense mutation in ALPL gene c.443 C>T: p.Thr148Ile. INTERVENTION: Asfotase alfa was requested due to important bone deterioration, ambulatory disability, and kidney impairment. It was given subcutaneously 2 mg/kg per dose, 3 times a week, for 12 months before reassessment. OUTCOMES: Bone mineral densities of the lumbar spine and whole body, besides almost all HR-pQCT microstructural parameters of the distal tibia, showed improvements and the patient was able to walk without assistant device. Kidney function did not further deteriorate. LESSONS: Hypophosphatasia should be considered as a differential diagnosis in young patients with multiple fractures and kidney impairment, since the use of antiresorptive drugs, calcium and vitamin D, commonly used to treat fractures, worsen its symptoms and prognosis. A 12-month asfotase alfa treatment improved bone density and structural parameters even in an adult patient with late diagnosis.

AB  - Calcium carbonate is an inorganic salt primarily used to manage and treat low calcium conditions, GERD, CKD, and other indicated conditions. Calcium carbonate is classified as a calcium supplement, antacid, and phosphate binder. This activity outlines the significant indications, actions, and contraindications for calcium carbonate as a valuable agent in treating osteoporosis, hypothyroidism, rheumatoid arthritis, and many other conditions or disorders that lower serum calcium levels. As an antacid, calcium carbonate also increases gastrointestinal motility and initiates peristalsis. Calcium carbonate works in the small intestines as a phosphate binder and drug chelator. In individuals with hyperphosphatemia or overdose, calcium will bind to form an insoluble compound blocking dietary phosphate or excess drug absorption and excreting it in feces. Calcium carbonate, used as a calcium supplement, also acts in the small intestine by chelating with oxalate to prevent absorption and renal calculi formation. Lastly, calcium carbonate also works in the blood to treat or prevent negative calcium balance seen in low serum calcium conditions. This activity will highlight the mechanism of action, adverse event profile, and other key factors (eg, off-label uses, dosing, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, monitoring, relevant interactions) pertinent for members of the healthcare team in the care of patients with low serum calcium, GERD, CKD, and related conditions.

AB  - The effects of an alkalizer or an acidifier on bladder carcinogenesis induced by OPP or OPP-Na were examined. Groups of 31 male F344/DuCrj rats were given 1.25% OPP in the diet (group 1), 1.25% OPP in the diet plus 0.4% sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) in drinking-water (group 2), 2% OPP-Na in the diet (group 3) or 2% OPP-Na in the diet plus 1% ammonium chloride (NH4Cl) in drinking-water (group 4) for 26 wk. Urinary bladder tumours, papilloma and carcinoma occurred in 12/31 (39%) of group 1, 20/31 (65%) of group 2, 22/31 (71%) of group 3 and 3/31 (10%) of group 4. Values of urinary pH after 25 wk of treatment were correlated with the tumour incidences. The results indicate that the administration of an alkalizer enhanced the carcinogenicity of OPP and the administration of an acidifer inhibited the carcinogenicity of OPP-Na to the rat urinary bladder. This suggests that the earlier finding that OPP-Na was more carcinogenic than OPP resulted from the higher alkalinity of OPP-Na.

AB  - A 38 year old female underwent a proctocolectomy and ileostomy for ulcerative colitis in February, 1974. For 8 year post-operatively, she excreted innumerable renal stones, mainly composed of uric acid. Her urine was highly acidic and hyperuricosuric with a low concentration of sodium. Sodium bicarbonate 4 gm/day, t.i.d., was started in October 1985, after which her renal stone excretion completely ceased (up until March, 1987), except for one incidence of stone excretion when she discontinued therapy for a week. During the sodium bicarbonate therapy, her urinary pH and Na concentration were elevated. Furthermore, sodium bicarbonate significantly elevated the urinary pH and Na concentration of other ileostomy patients. Thus, sodium bicarbonate could be used for the possible prophylaxis of uric acid formation in selected ileostomy patients.

AB  - Seven patients (13.0%) among 54 patients with inflammatory bowel disease treated by extensive colonic resection were complicated by renal stone. The mean urinary pH value in cases complicated by renal stones (5.3 +/- 0.4) was significantly lower than among those without stones (6.1 +/- 0.3, P less than 0.01). Sodium bicarbonate (4 gm/day, q.i.d.) was given to 11 patients with renal stones and/or hematuria, whose urinary pH was lower than 5.0 or whose urinary sediments were positive for uric acid crystals since Oct. 1985. Their urinary pH and Na concentration increased significantly and no renal stone complication has been seen in the treated group.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Urethral calculi are rare and usually encountered in males with urethral pathology. OBJECTIVE: To present our experience managing urethral calculi in a resource limited centre and review the literature. METHODS: We did a chart review of management of patients with urethral calculi between January and April 2009, at Federal Medical Centre (FMC) Azare, Nigeria. We also reviewed the literature on this rare condition. RESULTS: Four young adult male Nigerians between the ages of 17 and 27 years presented with varying degrees of urethral pain and palpable calculi in the anterior urethra. Two presented with acute retention of urine, but none had haematuria. The calculi were radio-opaque, located in the anterior urethra with no associated urethral pathology. Three were solitary and one multiple. The composition of the urethral calculi was a mixture of calcium oxalate calcium carbonate, magnesium phosphate, one has additional cystine but none had struvite or uric acid. Their sizes ranged between 1cm x1.5cm and 1.5cm x 5.5cm. External urethrotomy was the method of treatment. CONCLUSION: Urethral calculi are rare in our setting, with no clear identifiable aetiological factors which suggests urinary schistosomiasisbeing associsted. The occurrence of urethral calculi appears to have a relationship with childhood urinary schistosomasis.

AB  - A 5-year-old guinea pig was presented to the University of Berne Small Animal Radiology Department for an ultrasound examination of the abdomen to confirm a suspected diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. The patient had bilateral alopecia, was apathic and obese. Ultrasonographically, a tumor of the left adrenal gland, obstruction of the left ureter by an ureterolith, as well as hydronephrosis of the left kidney were detected. During surgery to relieve the ureteral obstruction the adrenal gland tumor was removed. The guinea pig died post-operatively due to blood loss. The left adrenal gland tumor was found histopathologically to be an adenoma and the right adrenal gland also had multiple small adenomas, but grossly appeared normal. The ureterolith was analyzed and found by x-ray diffraction to consist of calcium carbonate.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To identify an appropriate sampling technique(s) to accurately detect the bacteria causing urinary tract infections in dogs with urolithiasis. METHODS: Twenty-one dogs with urolithiasis were included in the study. Three types of samples were taken from each dog. Urine was collected by cystocentesis, and a urinary bladder mucosal biopsy and urolith were retrieved during cystotomy. The samples were then cultured on blood agar and MacConkey's agar to identify the bacteria associated with urinary tract infections. RESULTS: Bacterial urinary tract infection was found in 16 cases (76.19 per cent). The most prevalent bacteria found to cause urinary tract infection were Escherichia coli (n=7), followed by coagulase-positive Staphylococcus species (n=4), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n=2), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n=2) and Proteus mirabilis (n=1). In the case of a positive urine culture, the same bacteria were also cultured from the urinary bladder mucosal biopsy alone or from both the urinary bladder mucosal biopsy and urolith. However, in the case of a negative urine culture, bacteria were found to be present in the urinary bladder mucosal biopsy or urolith cultures in 23.81 per cent of dogs. The uroliths that gave positive culture results were either infection-induced uroliths composed of struvite and calcium carbonate phosphate, ammonium acid urate only or metabolic uroliths composed of calcium oxalate and calcium phosphate, or calcium phosphate only. All the uroliths that gave negative culture results were metabolic uroliths composed of calcium oxalate and/or calcium phosphate, and uric acid and calcium phosphate. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: When the culture from the urine obtained by cystocentesis is negative, cultures of urinary bladder mucosal biopsy and urolith are recommended in dogs with urolithiasis in order to accurately assess the microbiological status of the urinary tract.

AB  - Of 8,129 specimens submitted as urinary stones from 6,095 patients, 67 from 15 patients were predominantly calcium carbonate or calcium magnesium carbonate (dolomite) by infrared analysis. Detailed study of 1 man and 4 women who submitted 3 or more such specimens showed that all were of aragonite calcium carbonate crystal form in 2 women and all calcite in the man. All 3 patients had a long history of nephrolithiasis preceding submission of calcium carbonate stones. There was frequent and often painful spontaneous passage of many small stones. Medullary sponge kidney was reported in 2 patients. Specimens submitted by the other 2 women included dolomite and quartz artifacts. Of the other 10 patients 4 had calcite and 1 had aragonite (possibly true stones). Five patients had artifacts with dolomite in 3 and mixed specimens in 2. True calcium carbonate kidney stones and calcium carbonate artifacts may be difficult to distinguish, and dolomite and quartz artifacts may require x-ray diffraction for clear-cut diagnosis.

AB  - Idiopathic kidney stones originate mainly from calcium phosphate deposits at the tip of renal papillae, known as Randall's plaques (RPs), also detected in most human kidneys without stones. However, little is known about the mechanisms involved in RP formation. The localization and characterization of such nanosized objects in the kidney remain a real challenge, making their study arduous. This study provides a nanoscale analysis of the chemical composition and morphology of incipient RPs, characterizing in particular the interface between the mineral and the surrounding organic compounds. Relying on data gathered from a calculi collection, the morphology and chemical composition of incipient calcifications in renal tissue were determined using spatially resolved electron energy-loss spectroscopy. We detected microcalcifications and individual nanocalcifications found at some distance from the larger ones. Strikingly, concerning the smaller ones, we show that two types of nanocalcifications coexist: calcified organic vesicles and nanometric mineral granules mainly composed of calcium phosphate with carbonate in their core. Interestingly, some of these nanocalcifications present similarities with those reported in physiological bone or pathological cardiovascular biominerals, suggesting possible common formation mechanisms. However, the high diversity of these nanocalcifications suggests that several mechanisms may be involved (nucleation on a carbonate core or on organic compounds). In addition, incipient RPs also appear to present specific features at larger scales, revealing secondary calcified structures embedded in a fibrillar organic material. Our study proves that analogies exist between physiological and pathological biominerals and provides information to understand the physicochemical processes involved in pathological calcification formation.

AB  - A large proportion of urinary stones have calcium oxalate (CaOx) as the major mineral phase. In these stones, CaOx is generally associated with minor amounts of other calcium salts. Several reports showing the presence of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) and calcium phosphate in renal stones suggested that crystals of those salts might be present in the early steps of stone formation. Such crystals might therefore promote CaOx crystallization from supersaturated urine by providing an appropriate substrate for heterogeneous nucleation. That possibility was investigated by seeding a metastable solution of 45Ca oxalate with vaterite or calcite crystallites. Accretion of CaOx was monitored by 45Ca incorporation. We showed that (1) seeds of vaterite (the hexagonal polymorph of CaCO3) and calcite (the rhomboedric form) could initiate calcium oxalate crystal growth; (2) in the presence of lithostathine, an inhibitor of CaCO3 crystal growth, such accretion was not observed. In addition, scanning electron microscopy demonstrated that growth occurred by epitaxy onto calcite seeds whereas no special orientation was observed onto vaterite. It was concluded that calcium carbonate crystals promote crystallization of calcium oxalate and that inhibitors controlling calcium carbonate crystal formation in Henle's loop might play an important role in the prevention of calcium oxalate stone formation.

AB  - The NaHCO3 cotransporter NBCn1 plays a role in neutralizing intracellular acid loads at the basolateral membrane in cells of the medullary thick ascending limb (mTAL). Calcineurin inhibitors (Cn-Is) are known to both downregulate NBCn1 expression in the distal nephron and cause renal tubular acidosis (RTA), a risk factor for nephrocalcinosis and nephrolithiasis. In this report, we provide a new perspective on concurrent studies of NBCn1 in various tissues by using cell-free binding assays to investigate the interaction of NBCn1 with the calcineurin (Cn) isoform PPP3CA. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analyses show that the protein domain Exon 7 (translated from cassette II of NBCn1) binds Cn with an equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) of 30 +/- 15 nm. Linked-reaction tests suggest that the binding involves a conformational change. Nested PCR reactions were used to show that NBCn1-Exon 7 splice variants with alternative N-termini regions are expressed in the kidney, as well as other tissues. Additionally, we discuss NBCn1-Exon 7 implication in acid-base balance and calcium crystallization in the kidney.

AB  - Two hundred patients suffering from peptic ulcer have been examined for urinary stones. Two hundred healthy controls have been similary studied. In 14 patients from the first group (7%) urinary calculi were found, whereas the percentage in the second group was only 1%. This difference is statistically significant (P less than 0.01) (x2 distribution test). The increased incidence of peptic ulcer was attributed to the consumption of calcium in combination with easily absorbable alkalis (sodium bicarbonate). These findings must be considered in therapy for peptic ulcer diathesis.

AB  - Alkaptonuria is a rare disease of phenylalanine, aromatic amino acids, and tyrosine metabolism. Because of a genetic deficiency of the enzyme homogentisic acid oxidase, an accumulation of homogentisic acid causes ochronotic pigment deposition. The most common clinical manifestations are arthropathy, urinary calculi and discoloration, cutaneous and cartilaginous pigmentation, and cardiac valvular disease. Arthropathy and aortic stenosis are the most debilitating manifestations of the disease. A case of alkaptonuric aortic stenosis is described. A 75-year-old woman with a history of alkaptonuria presented in the emergency department with complaints of progressive dyspnea. Upon examination, the patient was hypertensive, tachypneic, and tachycardic with premature ventricular contractions. She had pitting edema of the lower extremities and complaints of generalized weakness. Chest x-rays revealed congestive heart failure and pulmonary edema. Diuretics were administered, and a continuous nitroglycerin infusion was initiated in the emergency department. The patient was admitted for further evaluation. The patient's respiratory status continued to decline. She was intubated endotracheally 1 day after admission. Subsequent cardiac evaluation revealed an ejection fraction of 35%, severe aortic stenosis, mild coronary artery disease, ischemic cardiomyopathy, and anteroapical akinesis. A dobutamine infusion was instituted for persistent hypotension, and renal dose dopamine was initiated for oliguric renal failure. The patient underwent an emergency operation for an aortic valve replacement with a Dacron patch 10 days after admission. Cardiopulmonary bypass and mild hypothermia were used during the procedure. The patient's hemodynamic status remained tenuous throughout the procedure. Although the first attempt to wean off cardiopulmonary bypass failed, the second attempt was successful with the aid of an intra-aortic balloon pump, inotropic support, and atrioventricular pacing. These measures were maintained during transport to the surgical intensive care unit. In the intensive care unit, the patient did not have an audible blood pressure or a palpable pulse without the support of the intra-aortic balloon pump and atrioventricular pacing. Coarse atrial fibrillation was the underlying electrocardiogram rhythm in the absence of atrioventricular pacing. Sodium bicarbonate was given without improvement. After discussion with the family, all life support measures were discontinued. The patient died 10 minutes after her arrival in the intensive care unit. Alkaptonuria's pathogenesis is manifested as both local and systemic in nature. Collagen vascular diseases share a similar pattern of multisystem involvement. Despite the negative outcome for the patient described, valuable insight can be obtained by studying this case and noting the anesthetic considerations specific to collagen vascular diseases in general.

AB  - The relationship involving acid-base imbalance, mineral metabolism and bone health status has previously been reported but the efficacy of the alkalizing supplementation in targeting acid overload and preventing bone loss has not yet been fully elucidated. In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, the hypothesis that potassium citrate (K citrate) modifies bone turnover in women with postmenopausal osteopenia was tested. Three hundred and ten women were screened; 40 women met the inclusion criteria and were randomly assigned to the treatment or the placebo group. They were treated with K citrate (30 mEq day(-1)) or a placebo in addition to calcium carbonate (500 mg day(-1)) and vitamin D (400 IU day(-1)). At baseline and time points of 3 and 6 months, serum indicators of renal function, electrolytes, calciotropic hormones, serum bone turnover markers (BTMs), tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase 5b (TRACP5b), carboxy-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen (CTX), bone alkaline phosphatase (BAP), procollagen type 1 N terminal propeptide (PINP)), and urine pH, electrolytes, and citrate were measured. The follow-up was completed by 17/20 patients in the "K citrate" group and 18/20 patients in the "placebo" group. At baseline, 90% of the patients exhibited low potassium excretion in 24 h urine samples, and 85% of cases had at least one urine parameter associated with low-grade acidosis (low pH, low citrate excretion). After treatment, CTX and BAP decreased significantly in both groups, but subjects with evidence of low-grade acidosis gained significant benefits from the treatment compared to the placebo. In patients with low 24h-citrate excretion at baseline, a 30% mean decrease in BAP and CTX was observed at 6 months. A significant reduction was also evident when low citrate (BAP: -25%; CTX: -35%) and a low pH (BAP: -25%; CTX: -30%) were found in fasting-morning urine. In conclusion, our results suggested that K citrate supplementation improved the beneficial effects of calcium and vitamin D in osteopenic women with a documented potassium and citrate deficit, and a metabolic profile consistent with low-grade acidosis.

AB  - Oxalic acid and oxalates are secondary metabolites secreted to the surrounding environment by fungi, bacteria, and plants. Oxalates are linked to a variety of processes in soil, e.g. nutrient availability, weathering of minerals, or precipitation of metal oxalates. Oxalates are also mentioned among low-molecular weight compounds involved indirectly in the degradation of the lignocellulose complex by fungi, which are considered to be the most effective degraders of wood. The active regulation of the oxalic acid concentration is linked with enzymatic activities; hence, the biochemistry of microbial biosynthesis and degradation of oxalic acid has also been presented. The potential of microorganisms for oxalotrophy and the ability of microbial enzymes to degrade oxalates are important factors that can be used in the prevention of kidney stone, as a diagnostic tool for determination of oxalic acid content, as an antifungal factor against plant pathogenic fungi, or even in efforts to improve the quality of edible plants. The potential role of fungi and their interaction with bacteria in the oxalate-carbonate pathway are regarded as an effective way for the transfer of atmospheric carbon dioxide into calcium carbonate as a carbon reservoir.

X-ray examinations were performed every three weeks to detect early formations of urinary bladder calculi, while an intravenous pyelogram and cystography served as a method for detection of neoplastic alterations. No statistical correlation could be established between the occurrence of urinary bladder stones and neoplasma in the various groups.

AB  - Twenty cases of silica stones (including a personal one, the first case ever observed--April 1952) are reviewed. Almost all of the patients had been taking magnesium trisilicate for several years, one up to 40 years. The average age of the patients was 54 years. There were 9 males and 1 female. The patients came from the following locations, given in chronological order: Beirut, Lebanon (1952); Stockholm, Sweden (1953, 1962); Houston, Tex., USA (1958, 1961); New York, N.Y., USA (1960); Johannesburg, South Africa (1964); London, UK (1973, 1982); Osaka, Japan (1978); Madrid, Spain (1978, 1981); and Torrance, Calif., USA (1984). 14 patients passed out the stones spontaneously. In 3 patients, the stone was formed in the left kidney. Bilateral renal stones were found in 2 patients. In 2 patients, they were removed from the left ureter and in 2 patients they were found in the bladder. The size of the stones varied between 2 mm and 3 cm, the weight from 8 mg to 3.6 g. The silica stone is of a relatively low radio density. Our case is the only one in whom the level of urinary silica was determined; it was of the order of 0.006% i.e. 1 mmol/l.

AB  - We reviewed patient records with a first-listed diagnosis of urolithiasis-also known as urinary tract or kidney stone disease, nephrolithiasis-upon discharge from Guam's sole civilian hospital during 2006 to 2010 and urinary cancer mortality records from the Guam Cancer Registry for 1970 to 2009 to determine the source of municipal water supplied to the patients' residence. The objective was to investigate a possible relationship between the sources of municipal water supplied to Guam villages and the incidence of urolithiasis and urinary cancer. We analyzed hospital discharge diagnoses of urolithiasis or renal calculi by calculating the incidence of first-mentioned discharge for urolithiasis or renal calculi and comparing rates across demographic or geographic categories while adjusting by age, sex, and ethnicity/race. We reviewed cancer registry records of urinary cancer deaths by patient residence. The annual incidence of hospitalization for urolithiasis was 5.22 per 10,000. Rates adjusted for sex or age exhibited almost no change. The rate of 9.83 per 10,000 among Chamorros was significantly higher (p < 0.05) than the rates among any other ethnic group or race. When villages were grouped by water source, rates of patients discharged with a first-listed diagnosis of urolithiasis, adjusted for ethnicity/race, were similar for villages using either well water (5.44 per 10,000) or mixed source water (5.39 per 10,000), and significantly greater than the rate for villages using exclusively reservoir water (1.35 per 10,000). No statistically significant differences were found between the water source or village of residence and urinary cancer mortality. Some Guam residents living in villages served completely or partly by deep well water high in calcium carbonate may be at increased risk for urolithiasis compared with residents living in villages served by surface waters. Although the risk appears to be highest in villagers of Chamorro ethnicity, residents should be aware of other contributing risk factors and steps to take to avoid developing this health problem.

AB  - Drug-induced urinary calculi are rarely observed. However, it is useful to know this etiology. A complete anamnesis of drugs and dosages is mandatory if a patient presents with lithiasis, since some pharmacotherapies may carry an enhanced lithogenic risk. The list of lithogenic drugs is discussed. In order to yield preventive data, infrared, spectrophotometry is the best available analytic method.

AB  - Four cases with ureteral obstruction due to uric acid or cystine stones were treated successfully by percutaneous irrigation with sodium bicarbonate or tromethamine-E. These cases underwent percutaneous nephrostomy for the reason of prolonged complete obstruction (case 1), sustained pyelonephritis (case 2) or decreased renal function (case 3 and 4). Two catheters were placed through the nephrostomy tract before irrigation, 6 Fr. ureteral catheter just above the ureteral stone and 10 Fr. pigtail or 12 Fr. Malecot catheter in the renal pelvis. The ureteral stones were markedly reduced in size and passed spontaneously after 6-11 days' duration of irrigation in three cases. In case 2, the remaining stone was removed transurethrally after 14 days' duration of irrigation, and was found to be composed of organic matrix. Percutaneous dissolution is considered to be a safe and reliable method and may be an alternative way of treating uric acid or cystine stone causing acute ureteral obstruction.

AB  - A 29-year-old insulin-dependent diabetic woman developed phosphate depletion, nephrolithiasis and bilateral ureteric obstruction due to antacid abuse. Unlike previous descriptions of chronic phosphate depletion, myalgia, weakness and bone pain were absent. Biochemical features included hypophosphataemia, hypercalciuria, hypophosphaturia, elevated plasma, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D and low plasma intact parathyroid hormone. These abnormalities were corrected when antacid ingestion was reduced and phosphate intake supplemented. We propose that phosphate depletion secondary to antacid abuse caused 1 alpha-hydroxylase activation and elevation of the plasma 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D level, leading to marked hypercalciuria. Once diagnosed, antacid abuse is a readily reversible cause of hypercalciuria and renal stones. Moreover, antacid-induced phosphate depletion may present with nephrolithiasis in the absence of musculoskeletal symptoms. This report is intended to draw attention to this important cause of renal stone disease.

AB  - CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is generally a late-onset multisystem disorder characterized by bilateral kidney cysts, liver cysts, and an increased risk of intracranial aneurysms. Other manifestations include: cysts in the pancreas, seminal vesicles, and arachnoid membrane; dilatation of the aortic root and dissection of the thoracic aorta; mitral valve prolapse; and abdominal wall hernias. Kidney manifestations include early-onset hypertension, kidney pain, and kidney insufficiency. Approximately 50% of individuals with ADPKD have end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) by age 60 years. The prevalence of liver cysts increases with age and occasionally results in clinically significant severe polycystic liver disease (PLD), most often in females. Overall, the prevalence of intracranial aneurysms is fivefold higher than in the general population and further increased in those with a positive family history of aneurysms or subarachnoid hemorrhage. There is substantial variability in the severity of kidney disease and other extra-kidney manifestations. DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: The diagnosis of ADPKD is established in a proband with age-specific kidney imaging criteria and either an affected first-degree relative with ADPKD or a heterozygous pathogenic variant in PKD1, PKD2, or one of the less common associated genes (ALG5, ALG9, DNAJB11, GANAB, IFT140) identified by molecular genetic testing. MANAGEMENT: Treatment of manifestations: Treatment with vasopressin V2 receptor antagonists (e.g., tolvaptan) to slow disease progression is approved for individuals with rapidly progressive disease. Treatment for hypertension may include ACE inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers and diet modification. Delayed onset of ESKD has been suggested with lipid control; low osmolar intake (e.g., moderate sodium and protein); increased hydration by moderate water intake; maintenance of sodium bicarbonate >/=22 mEq/L; moderation of dietary phosphorus intake; moderation of caloric intake; and low-impact exercise to maintain normal body mass index. Conservative treatment of flank pain includes nonopioid agents, tricyclic antidepressants, narcotic analgesics, and splanchnic nerve blockade. More aggressive treatments include cyst decompression with cyst aspiration and sclerosis, laparoscopic or surgical cyst fenestration, kidney denervation, and nephrectomy. Cyst hemorrhage and/or gross hematuria usually responds to bed rest, analgesics, and adequate hydration. Severe bleeding may require transfusion, segmental arterial embolization, or surgery. Treatment of nephrolithiasis is standard. Treatment of cyst infections is difficult, with a high failure rate. Therapeutic agents of choice include trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, fluoroquinolones, clindamycin, vancomycin, and metronidazole. ESKD is treated with dialysis and transplantation. Symptomatic liver cysts may improve with avoidance of estrogens and the use of H2 blockers or proton pump inhibitors. Severe symptoms may require percutaneous aspiration and sclerosis, laparoscopic fenestration, combined hepatic resection and cyst fenestration, liver transplantation, or selective hepatic artery embolization. The mainstay of therapy for ruptured or symptomatic intracranial aneurysm is surgical clipping of the ruptured aneurysm at its neck; however, for some individuals, endovascular treatment with detachable platinum coils may be indicated. Thoracic aortic replacement is indicated when the aortic root diameter reaches 55-60 mm. Surveillance: CT or MRI examination of the abdomen with and without contrast enhancement every one to five years in adults depending on disease stage; blood pressure monitoring every three years beginning at age five years in those with normal blood pressure; urine studies for microalbuminuria or proteinuria every one to five years in adults depending on disease stage; echocardiography or chest MRI every two to three years in adults with a first-degree relative with thoracic aortic dissection; MRA examination for intracranial aneurysms in adults determined to be at high risk. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Long-term administration of nephrotoxic agents, high levels of caffeine, high-salt diet, smoking, and obesity, and in individuals with severe PLD, use of estrogens and possibly progestogens. Evaluation of relatives at risk: Testing of adult relatives at risk permits early diagnosis, initiation of treatment, and treatment of associated complications. Pregnancy management: Pregnant women with ADPKD should be monitored for the development of hypertension, urinary tract infections, oligohydramnios, and preeclampsia; the fetus should be monitored for intrauterine fetal growth restriction, oligohydramnios, and fetal kidney anomalies including cysts, enlarged size, and atypical echogenicity. GENETIC COUNSELING: In most affected families, ADPKD is caused by a heterozygous PKD1 or PKD2 pathogenic variant and inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. More rarely, ADPKD is caused by a heterozygous pathogenic variant in ALG5, ALG9, DNAJB11, GANAB, or IFT140. Complex inheritance (biallelic PKD1- or PKD2-related ADPKD or digenic ADPKD) may play a role in a minority of families and is important when considering the risk to other family members. Most individuals diagnosed with ADPKD have an affected parent; 10%-20% of affected individuals have the disorder as the result of a de novo pathogenic variant. Each child of an individual who is heterozygous for an ADPKD-causing pathogenic variant has a 50% chance of inheriting the pathogenic variant. Once the ADPKD-causing pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal and preimplantation genetic testing are possible.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Between 2006 and 2014, 10 cases of urolithiasis in yaks with calcium carbonate uroliths were confirmed in Switzerland, and at the same time, a sixfold calcium overhang in roughage in an affected farm was evident. The purpose of this study was the question of whether urolithiasis in yaks in the alpine regions of Switzerland poses a husbandry risk. The hypothesis was that elevated calcium levels in roughage led to hypercalcemia and, thus, the formation of calcium carbonate stones. METHODS: Blood samples from 99 animals from 10 farms were examined (n = 6 problem farms; n = 4 control farms). Several metabolites were analyzed in the blood and urine. In addition, roughage, soil, and water samples were analyzed. The farms were distributed within different regions of Switzerland. RESULTS: This study revealed different Ca:P ratios, from 1.56 to 7.74:1, in the forages and mild hypercalcemia in the animals of the problem farms. In a univariate analysis of the problem versus control farms, about 20 other significant factors emerged. Multivariate analysis showed that altitude, CP (crude protein), P, Mg, NDF, and ADF in the diet are important factors. Based on analysis of the pedigree, there was no evidence of an obvious genetic background of urolithiasis. LIMITATIONS: A limitation of this study is the small number of yaks in Switzerland. CONCLUSIONS: The question of whether urolithiasis in yaks in alpine Switzerland poses a husbandry risk can be answered affirmatively. Calcium-rich forages play a crucial role in this multifactorial process.

AB  - Between May 1989 and November 1991, 19 staghorn calculi were treated by extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy (ESWL) with a Dornier MFL 5000 or Northgate SD-3. The 19 calculi were evaluated. Treatment was with monotherapy by ESWL in 9, combination percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PNL)-ESWL in 9, and nephrostomy in 1. Of the patients, 14 had a cross stent catheter pre-ESWL treatment to improve fragment evacuation. Radiologic follow up in 19 kidneys revealed that 57.9% were stone free. We arbitrarily separated our cases into 3 groups: struvite renal calculi, calcium carbonate calculi and others. Result of stone-free rate was 100% for stones consisting of struvite, and 14. 3% for stones consisting of calcium carbonate. In our opinion, the best indication of monotherapy by ESWL is for staghorn calculi, which consists of struvite, without marked dilation of pelvis and calyces.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the mineral composition of calculi, anatomic locations of the calculi, and findings of urinalysis and bacteriologic culture of urine and calculi in guinea pigs with urolithiasis. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. ANIMALS: 127 guinea pigs. PROCEDURES: Records of urinary calculi that had been submitted to the University of California Stone Laboratory from 1985 through 2003 were reviewed. In addition, submissions of urinary calculi for evaluation by the laboratory were prospectively solicited from 2004 through 2007. Prospectively obtained calculi were accompanied by a urine sample for urinalysis and bacteriologic culture and a completed questionnaire. All calculi were analyzed by use of polarized light microscopy and infrared spectroscopy. A subset of calculi was examined by means of x-ray diffractometry (XRD). RESULTS: 83% (43/52) of calculi from the laboratory database and 93% (70/75) of calculi that were prospectively solicited were composed of 100% calcium carbonate. Analysis via XRD confirmed that 5 of 6 calculi from a subset that had the greatest gross morphologic variation were composed of 100% calcite. Although many guinea pigs had received anti-microbials before bacteriologic cultures of urine were performed, Corynebacterium renale was isolated from 5 urine samples. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Contrary to findings of other studies, urinary calculi analyzed for the present study were most commonly composed of 100% calcium carbonate, and infrared spectroscopy or XRD was necessary to differentiate this mineral from others. Treatments, including diet and husbandry practices, should be developed to help prevent development of calcium carbonate calculi in guinea pigs.

AB  - Antacid ingestion may lead to side-effects related to their chemical composition. Aluminum hydroxide may cause the phosphate depletion syndrome even during short-term administration of high doses in patients at high risk, such as alcoholics. Long-term intake may lead to bone demineralization and to osteomalacia. Fluoride complexing in the gut and prevention of fluoride absorption may be an additional factor. The clinical relevance of aluminum absorption in patients with normal renal function is not clear. In contrast, in patients with renal failure, aluminum hydroxide ingestion may contribute to an increasing hyperaluminemia. Hyperaluminemia and tissue deposition of aluminum in these patients may contribute to the dialysis-associated encephalopathy. Magnesium hydroxide causes an alkalinization of the urine due to magnesium absorption and urinary excretion. Thus, in renal insufficiency, a life-threatening hypermagnesemia may develop if magnesium-aluminum-containing antacids are prescribed. The milk-alkali syndrome, rarely observed nowadays, may be caused by calcium carbonate- and sodium bicarbonate-containing antacids. Hypercalciuria and alkaluria predispose to nephrolithiasis. The possibility that these disturbances in mineral metabolism will develop in patients with normal renal function is unlikely unless there is an abuse of these "over the counter" antacids.

AB  - Side effects of antacid therapy are dose dependant and compound related. High dose antacid intake may lead to fluid retention in the body depending on the sodium content of the different antacid preparations. Sodium bicarbonate ingestion provokes metabolic alkalosis and alkaliuria, the "nonsystemic calcium and magnesium containing antacids" cause these changes too, but to a lower degree. Urinary pH elevation favours the precipitation of calcium and magnesium salts, predisposing to renal stone formation. In patients with renal insufficiency the calcium and magnesium absorption may lead rapidly to toxic serum concentrations. Calcium and magnesium containing acids may provoke an acid rebound, which is clinically not relevant following magnesium-hydroxide-ingestion. Phosphorus depletion is an important side effect of aluminum hydroxide intake. The phosphorus depletion syndrome combined with skeletal demineralisation and osteomalacia may occur. As well as calcium and magnesium cations the tribasic aluminum will be absorbed from the gut in small amounts. In patients with renal insufficiency aluminum deposition in the brain grey matter following Al(OH)3 ingestion will occur and seems to be a co-factor for the development of a dialysis encephalopathy syndrome. The clinical relevance of aluminum absorption from gut in patients with normal renal function is unknown until now.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The value of repeated analyses of 24-hour urine collections for daily excretion of calcium, uric acid, citrate, phosphorus, and creatinine and for volume and pH performed to detect and classify metabolic disorders in a selected group of calcium stone formers with striking recurrence rates was assessed in a retrospective study. METHODS: A total of 441 urinalyses made over a mean period of 80.4 months of samples obtained from 49 patients were reviewed. Fifty-nine percent of patients were initially found to have metabolic disorders (absorptive hypercalciuria types I and II, hyperuricuria, hypocitraturia) and therefore received specific drug therapy (allopurinol, thiazide, alkali citrate, orthophosphate) for a mean of 45.7 months (group I). The remaining patients were classified as metabolically inactive and were given general metaphylactic instructions (group II). RESULTS: In 73% of patients recurrent stones developed, with no statistically significant difference between the two groups (79% vs 65%). In 55% of group I patients, urinalyses continued to yield abnormal findings during follow-up; however, subsequent abnormal findings were also seen in 40% of the metabolically inactive group II patients. Overall, metabolic disorders were observed at some point in 75% of patients. Only 27% remained recurrence free, and 62% thereof also had pathologic urinary findings. CONCLUSIONS: It does not appear that drug treatment in recurrent calcium urolithiasis based on urinary findings is superior to simple general metaphylactic recommendations, nor that repeated analyses of 24-hour urine collections furnish additional information on the risk of recurrent stone formation or on the presence of risk factors leading to recurrence in the long-term course of disease.

AB  - In a pharmacokinetic and tolerance study, 2 healthy Beagles were given 13.2 to 39.5 mg of 2-mercaptopropionylglycine (2-MPG)/kg of body weight orally once daily in increasing doses for 3 weeks. A third dog was given 10 mg of 2-MPG/kg of body weight, IV. The drug was well tolerated. After these initial studies, 15 cystinuric dogs were treated with 2-MPG orally once daily for 5 to 45 months and with sodium bicarbonate for urine alkalinization and fluid diuresis. Pharmacokinetic studies were done in 7 dogs on the third day of oral treatment with 2-MPG. After oral administration of 15.6 to 31.3 of 2-MPG/kg of body weight, maximal serum/plasma concentrations were from 28.6 to 76.3/mumol/L after 1 to 3 hours in 6 cystinuric dogs. The mean urinary excretion was 22% (range, 0.3 to 58.9%) of the dose. Ten of 15 cystinuric dogs had no re-formation of uroliths. Of 4 dogs with uroliths at the beginning of treatment, 3 had total urolith dissolution on continuous treatment. During treatment, further growth of the uroliths was inhibited in one dog, and in another dog with re-formed uroliths, they dissolved. We concluded that 2-MPG is well tolerated and promising for treatment of cystinuric dogs, but the pharmacokinetic studies should be expanded to include different dosage regimens, and results of long-term treatment should be evaluated. Our recommendations for treatment of dogs with cystine uroliths include surgical intervention if the dog has urethral obstruction or has dysuria.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

AB  - Near-infrared activated nanomaterials have been reported for biomedical applications ranging from photothermal tumor destruction to biofilm eradication and energy-gated drug delivery. However, the focus so far has been on soft tissues, and little is known about energy delivery to hard tissues, which have thousand-fold higher mechanical strength. We present photonic lithotripsy with carbon and gold nanomaterials for fragmenting human kidney stones. The efficacy of stone comminution is dependent on the size and photonic properties of the nanomaterials. Surface restructuring and decomposition of calcium oxalate to calcium carbonate support the contribution of photothermal energy to stone failure. Photonic lithotripsy has several advantages over current laser lithotripsy, including low operating power, noncontact laser operation (distances of at least 10 mm), and ability to break all common stones. Our observations can inspire the development of rapid, minimally invasive techniques for kidney stone treatment and extrapolate to other hard tissues such as enamel and bone.

AB  - Transendoscopic pulsed dye laser lithotripsy was effective in the treatment of calcium carbonate urothlithiasis in 2 adult geldings. Perineal urethrotomy provided convenient access for standing transendoscopic lithotripsy and evacuation of a large cystic calculus in one gelding. In the second horse, an obstructive urethral calculus was fragmented and removed by a transurethroscopic approach. Pulsed dye laser lithotriptor is effective in fragmentation of the most common form (calcium carbonate) of uroliths in horses and may be performed in standing horses with reduced surgical invasiveness and trauma to the urinary tract, compared with conventional approaches. The principle disadvantages include cost of the procedure, which is comparable to laparocystotomy, and the time delay required to make arrangements for use of the pulsed dye laser lithotriptor.

AB  - BACKGROUND: This study was conducted to evaluate the chemical composition of eight types of urinary calculi using spiral computerized tomography (CT) in vivo. METHODS: From October 2011 to February 2013, upper urinary tract calculi were obtained from 122 patients in the department of urinary surgery of the First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University. All patients were scanned with a 64-detector row helical CT scanner using 6.50 mm collimation before ureterorenoscopy. Data from the preoperative spiral CT scans and postoperative chemical composition of urinary calculi were collected. RESULTS: The chemical composition analysis indicates that there were five types of pure calculi and three types of mixed calculi, including 39 calcium oxalate calculi, 12 calcium phosphate calculi, 10 calcium carbonate calculi, 8 magnesium ammonium phosphate calculi, 6 carbonated apatite, 21 uric acid/ammonium urate calculi, 10 uric acid/calcium oxalate calculi, and 16 calcium oxalate/calcium phosphate calculi. There were significant differences in the mean CT values among the five types of pure calculi (P < 0.001). Furthermore, we also observed significant differences in the mean CT values among three types of mixed calculi (P < 0.001). Significant differences in the mean CT values were also found among eight types of urinary calculi (P < 0.001). However, no statistically significant difference was observed between the mean CT values of magnesium ammonium phosphate calculi and uric acid/calcium oxalate calculi (P = 0.262). CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that spiral CT could be a promising tool for determining the chemical composition of upper urinary tract calculi.

AB  - Long-time oral intake of magnesium-silicate-containing drugs is thought to be a causative factor inducing silicate urolithiasis. Besides, magnesium seems to play an anti-urolithogenic part in the formation of calcium oxalate stones. We report a recurrent calcium oxalate former who had been treated with magnesium aluminometasilicate antacid for gastric ulcer for approximately 17 years. One of the fragments found during extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy was identified as 100% silicate. Deposition of silica was also found on other fragments. A large dose of magnesium (given in a part of the drug) might have little influence on the formation of calcium oxalate.

AB  - Two cases of silica stones, without previous oral intake of magnesium trisilicate, are reported. A 64-year-old Japanese woman had bilateral renal stones. Infrared spectrophotoscopy revealed that one of the fragments consisted of silicate and the others consisted of calcium oxalate. A 75-year-old woman had right renal stones. The composition of 1 stone was a mixture of silicate and unspecified matrices. Silicate urolithiasis may not necessarily be related to oral intake of silicate-containing antacids.

AB  - The authors report a case of anuria due to bilateral ureteric obstruction by silica stones in a patient taking magnesium trisilicate for many years. A review of the literature concerning silica stones is presented. The diagnosis should be suggested by the clinical history and confirmed by stone analysis. The treatment of silica stones is not specific, but must be associated with withdrawal of the drug responsible.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The efficacy of calcium with vitamin D supplementation for preventing hip and other fractures in healthy postmenopausal women remains equivocal. METHODS: We recruited 36,282 postmenopausal women, 50 to 79 years of age, who were already enrolled in a Women's Health Initiative (WHI) clinical trial. We randomly assigned participants to receive 1000 mg of elemental [corrected] calcium as calcium carbonate with 400 IU of vitamin D3 daily or placebo. Fractures were ascertained for an average follow-up period of 7.0 years. Bone density was measured at three WHI centers. RESULTS: Hip bone density was 1.06 percent higher in the calcium plus vitamin D group than in the placebo group (P<0.01). Intention-to-treat analysis indicated that participants receiving calcium plus vitamin D supplementation had a hazard ratio of 0.88 for hip fracture (95 percent confidence interval, 0.72 to 1.08), 0.90 for clinical spine fracture (0.74 to 1.10), and 0.96 for total fractures (0.91 to 1.02). The risk of renal calculi increased with calcium plus vitamin D (hazard ratio, 1.17; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.02 to 1.34). Censoring data from women when they ceased to adhere to the study medication reduced the hazard ratio for hip fracture to 0.71 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.52 to 0.97). Effects did not vary significantly according to prerandomization serum vitamin D levels. CONCLUSIONS: Among healthy postmenopausal women, calcium with vitamin D supplementation resulted in a small but significant improvement in hip bone density, did not significantly reduce hip fracture, and increased the risk of kidney stones.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The treatment of cystine stones is a clinical problem. This in vitro study was performed to establish an experimental system that enables standardized and reproducible investigations on chemolysis of cystine stones to look for an improvement of dissolution strategies. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Artificial spherical stones made of cystine (BON(N)-STONES) with a diameter of 0.9 cm were used. A new dissolution device was developed simulating the physiological conditions in the upper urinary tract with computer-assisted online measurement of data. For chemolysis of artificial cystine stones, different solvents (artificial urine, physiologic sodium chloride solution, 2 % acetylcysteine, 8.4 % sodium bicarbonate solution, THAM, and combinations) were used. RESULTS: Chemolysis is an effective tool in the management of cystine stone disease. Statistical analysis showed significant differences (p < or = 0.05) for all solutions compared with artificial urine alone. A combination of THAM at pH 10 with acetylcysteine (2%) showed a 48-fold stronger ability to dissolve cystine calculi than did artificial urine. CONCLUSION: By performing standardized in vitro investigations, new basics to improve the dissolution of cystine stones have been developed. It is recommended to use artificial stones made of cystine and a dissolution device simulating physiological conditions for investigations on chemolysis in the future.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The prevalence of renal calculi in patients with gout is high. Alkalized urine has been recommended by the 2020 European Association of Urology (EAU) guidelines to promote calculus dissolution. However, randomized controlled trials are lacking. METHODS: In the protocol of this randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded trial, patients with gout combined with renal calculi are randomized (1:1) to the placebo and sodium bicarbonate groups. The intervention would be performed for 24 weeks, the 1-12 weeks are double-blinded, and the 13-24 weeks are open-labeled. Sodium bicarbonate (1 g tid) will be performed for 24 weeks in the sodium bicarbonate group. The placebo will be performed for 12 weeks and not be performed from 13 weeks to 24 weeks in the placebo group. All subjects will be administered febuxostat (40 mg/day) for 24 weeks and receive concomitant anti-inflammatory prophylaxis therapy for 12 weeks. The primary outcome is the proportion of patients whose renal calculus volume will be reduced after 12 weeks of treatment. The secondary outcomes include the volume changes of renal calculi, uric acid changes, the proportion of patients with serum uric acid (sUA) levels < 360 mumol/L, the changes in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), the pH value of urine, and the incidence of adverse events after treatment for 12 and 24 weeks. DISCUSSION: This study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of sodium bicarbonate-alkalized urine on renal calculi in patients with gout. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov ChiCTR2100045183.

AB  - Prophylactic treatment with magnesium hydroxide ws instituted in 56 consecutive cases with renal calcium stones. The patients had been investigated previously with regard to the magnesium metabolism. The urinary magnesium excretion increased promptly and remained on a higher level during treatment. No changes were observed in the serum or urinary calcium concentrations. Most patients have undergone treatment for at least 2 years and 45 have been free of recurrences of formations of new stones. The mean stone episode rate during treatment was 0.03 stones per year compared to 0.8 stones per year before treatment was instituted. The natural history of stone disease also was followed in 34 patients with stones who had received no prophylactic therapy and 15 have experienced recurrences after 2 years. Therefore, in comparison, treatment with magnesium hydroxide appeared to reduce the recurrence rate. Apart from minor gastrointestinal discomfort no adverse effects were observed during treatment.

AB  - Magnesium is a known inhibitor of the formation of calcium oxalate crystals in the urine and was proposed for prophylactic treatment in renal stone disease as early as the 17th and 18th centuries. We have treated 55 patients with recurrent renal calcium stone disease without signs of magnesium deficiency (normal serum magnesium, urinary magnesium, intracellular magnesium in muscle biopsies, gastrointestinal absorption of 28Mg, and magnesium loading test) from our outpatient stone clinic for up to four years with 500 mg Mg2+, in the form of Mg(OH)2, daily. The mean stone episode rate before therapy was 0.8 stones/year/patient. Forty-three recurrent renal calcium stone-formers without medical therapy served as controls. Serum magnesium increased initially but after one year returned to the pretreatment level. Urinary magnesium excretion increased promptly and remained elevated during the follow-up period. The urinary calcium excretion remained unchanged. The magnesium/calcium ratio in the urine increased and approached a value earlier found in healthy subjects without stone disease. Urinary citrate increased on therapy when analysed after three years of treatment. The mean stone episode rate decreased from 0.8 to 0.08 stones/year on treatment and 85% of the patients remained free of recurrence during follow-up, whereas 59% of the patients in the control group continued their stone formation. Side effects were few. Magnesium treatment in renal calcium stone disease is effective with few side effects. No clinical signs of magnesium excess were observed.

AB  - Cystine urolithiasis is the only clinical expression of cystinuria, an autosomal recessive genetic defect of the transepithelial transport of cystine and other dibasic amino acids in the kidney. Stones form due to the increased excretion of cystine, which is poorly soluble at normal urine pH. Cystine stones are often resistant to extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy, so that percutaneous surgery or ureteroscopy are the preferred techniques of stone extraction. Medical preventative treatment is based on high diuresis (>/=1.5 l/m(2) per day) well distributed throughout the day and night, and urine alkalinization up to pH 7.5 by means of sodium bicarbonate and/or potassium citrate. When these basal measures are ineffective at preventing stone recurrence or dissolving pre-existing stones, sulfhydryl agents such as D-penicillamine or tiopronin, which form highly soluble mixed disulfides with cystine moieties, are to be added to urine dilution and alkalinization, especially when cystine excretion is in excess of 750 mg/day (3 mmol/day). Frequent clinical and ultrasound follow-up is needed to encourage patient compliance and assess efficacy and tolerance of treatment.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Knowledge of the mineral composition of the causative urolith is important to develop preventative strategies. Advances in analytic techniques have led to detection of urolith components not previously recognized. HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study were to characterize uroliths in sheep and goats structurally and clinically. We hypothesized that amorphous magnesium calcium phosphate (AMCP) would be a naturally occurring urolith type in sheep and goats. ANIMALS: Forty-nine sheep and goats presenting for obstructive urolithiasis from June 15, 2014 through June 14, 2016 were reviewed along with the demographic data of all small ruminants admitted during that same period. METHODS: Medical records were reviewed for demographic and historical data, and 36 uroliths obtained from these cases during diagnostic or therapeutic procedures were analyzed by infrared spectroscopy to determine chemical composition. RESULTS: AMCP is a naturally occurring urolith type in obstructed male sheep and goats and was the most common urolith type in this study, where it occurred as a majority component with struvite (39% of uroliths) or as a pure component (11%). Pure struvite was found in 1 urolith (2%). Calcium carbonate was the second most frequent urolith with 31% of uroliths being pure calcium carbonate. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: This study demonstrates that uroliths, which appear consistent with struvite, could actually be calcium-containing AMCP. Urolith analysis is critical in determining mineral content of uroliths to guide dietary recommendations for prevention.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Calcium carbonate is a common urolith type in small ruminants with no high-yield experimental model to evaluate animal susceptibility or preventative measure response. HYPOTHESIS: That novel plastic winged implants would allow accumulation and quantification of calcium carbonate calculus formation in goats on a high-calcium diet and identify individual variation between goats in the mass of calculi produced. ANIMALS: Eight nonpregnant 3- and 4-year-old Boer-cross does, weighing 22.3-39.5 kg, determined to be healthy based on physical examination, were used in these experiments. METHODS: Prospective cohort study for in vivo experimental model development. Implants were placed into the urinary bladder lumen in 8 goats over 2 evaluation periods. The alfalfa-based ration had a total ration Ca : P of 3.29 and 3.84 : 1, respectively. Urine was collected at 0, 28, 56, and 84 days in the 1st experiment; blood and urine at those timepoints in the 2nd experiment. For each evaluation period, the implants were removed 84 days after implantation and weighed. Accumulated calculi mass was calculated and compared between goats and was analyzed for composition. RESULTS: Implant retention was 100% and 86% in the 2 studies. All goats with retained implants accumulated calcium carbonate at a mean implant gain per day across studies ranging from 0.44 to 57.45 mg. Two goats accumulated (0.44-7.65 mg/day and 33.64 & 57.45 mg/day) significantly more urolith material than the cohort across both studies (P = .047). No routine analytes on blood or urine were found to be explanatory for the difference observed. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: These findings form a basis for implant and diet selection for use in future studies of urolithiasis development and for studies regarding individual susceptibility to urolithiasis.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe a technique for endoscope-assisted disruption and removal of urinary calculi using a holmium:YAG laser in sedated, standing horses. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective study. ANIMALS: Six horses with urinary calculi. METHODS: A holmium:YAG laser was used to disrupt naturally occurring urinary calculi in horses (4 geldings, 1 stallion, 1 mare). Ischial urethrotomy was performed in male horses to provide a portal for the endoscope and laser fiber. Calculus fragments were removed by a combination of lavage, transendoscopic basket snare removal, forceps, and digital manipulation. Ischial urethrotomies healed by second intention. Follow-up was obtained by recheck examination and telephone interview of owners. RESULTS: No major operative or postoperative complications occurred. Two calculi (1 stallion and 1 mare) were fragmented by a combination of laser ablation and manual disruption with a lithotrite. Postoperative dysuria occurred in the mare, but resolved after 1 month. Mean (+/- SD) follow-up was 306 +/- 149 days; no other complications were reported. CONCLUSIONS: Calcium carbonate urinary calculi (up to 15 cm in diameter) in horses can be effectively fragmented with a holmium:YAG laser. It is not known if this technique would be completely effective for larger calculi or extremely dense calculi. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Calculus disruption by an endoscopically assisted holmium:YAG laser offers a minimally invasive method that can be performed in standing horses and that minimizes patient risk.

AB  - The objective of the present study was to investigate the matrix protein of a rare urinary stone that contained calcium carbonate. A urinary stone was extracted from a 34-year-old male patient with metabolic alkalosis. After X-ray diffractometry and infrared analysis of the stone, proteomic analysis was carried out. The resulting mass spectra were evaluated with protein search software, and matrix proteins were identified. X-ray diffraction and infrared analysis confirmed that the stone contained calcium carbonate and calcium oxalate dihydrate. Of the identified 53 proteins, 24 have not been previously reported from calcium oxalate- or calcium phosphate-containing stones. The protease inhibitors and several proteins related to cell adhesion or the cytoskeleton were identified for the first time. We analyzed in detail a rare urinary stone composed of calcium carbonate and calcium oxalate dihydrate. Considering the formation of a calcium carbonate stone, the new identified proteins should play an important role on the urolithiasis process in alkaline condition.

AB  - The use of real-time ultrasound for examination of the bladder was a useful diagnostic aid in 2 cases of cystic calculi. The ultrasound procedure revealed that a firm mass palpated per rectum in the bladder of one horse was a calculus. In the other horse, ultrasound revealed additional small uroliths. To remove the uroliths in both horses, laparocystidotomy via a ventral paramedian approach was chosen because it provided the best access to the bladder lumen. The calculi were analyzed by qualitative chemical analysis and quantitative crystallography. Results differed between analysis methods. Crystallography revealed that the mineral composition of both calculi was pure calcium carbonate. Chemical analysis erroneously indicated that the calculi contained phosphate, magnesium, and oxalate.

AB  - CASE HISTORY: A 3-year-old male, castrated Saanen goat was presented with an acute onset of vocalisation, abdominal discomfort and 'tail-flagging'. CLINICAL FINDINGS: Radiographs, including a positive-contrast study, indicated obstructive urolithiasis, and evidence of rupture of the urethra. Analysis of uroliths identified calcium carbonate crystals. Amputation of the urethral process could not re-establish urethral patency, so a tube cystotomy was performed but also was not successful. Eighteen days after admission, a perineal urethrostomy was performed. However, the goat's condition deteriorated 12 days after the urethrostomy, and the owner consented to euthanasia of the animal. Post-mortem examination revealed a hole 2x1 cm on the dorsal aspect of the bladder, and a necrotic focus measuring approximately 2x3 cm ventrally. DIAGNOSIS: Obstructive urolithiasis, with ruptured bladder and urethra. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Obstructive urolithiasis is probably an under-reported condition of castrated male goats in New Zealand.

AB  - Low levels of red blood cell (RBC) carbonic anhydrase (CA) activity in hemoglobin-free hemolyzate (HFH) were found in 2 children with nephrolithiasis when compared to age-matched controls. The lowest levels were consistently found over a two year period in a 6 1/2 year old boy (U.P.) whose renal calculi contained uric acid, ammonia, calcium carbonate and oxalate. His RBC CA values ranged from 1.4-2.7 U/g Hb compared with levels of 3.9-5.3 U/g Hb in control subjects. Statistical comparisons of the mean values for U.P., 2.06 U/g Hb, and his age-matched control subjects, 4.46 U/g Hb, revealed a significant difference (P = less than 0.001). Similar reductions in RBC CA activity were found in his father--2.0 and 2.1 U/g Hb compared with 3.3 and 3.9 U/g Hb in adult controls. HFH CA activity was not decreased in the mother or sister. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of HFH from 4 of the children and the father of U.P. was abnormal. However, this abnormal electrophoretic pattern could only be demonstrated when the gel was run for 120 minutes and not when it was run for 80 or 160 minutes. We have identified a patient and his father with low levels of RBC CA activity.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To study childhood nephrolithiasis and nephrocalcinosis caused by metabolic disorders, distal renal tubular acidosis (dRTA), and familial hypomagnesemia, hypercalciuria, and nephrocalcinosis (FHHNC). METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated 86 children presented over 10 years (2011-2021), with nephrolithiasis (89%) and nephrocalcinosis (11%) caused by metabolic disorders (62%), FHHNC (21%), and dRTA (17%). RESULTS: The mean age at discovery was 72.7 months. The underlying metabolic etiologies included hyperoxaluria (38%), cystinuria (32%), hypercalciuria (24%), and hyperuricosuria (6%). Genetic testing was carried out for 23 patients. Hyperoxaluria was typically treated medically (75%). However, the majority progressed to end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). Most children with cystinuria, hypercalciuria, and hyperuricosuria required medical and surgical intervention. Patients with FHHNC typically presented with nephrocalcinosis. Genetic testing revealed Claudin-16 mutations in 7 children. Patients often progressed to stage II-IV chronic kidney disease (61%) and ESKD (6%). Patients with dRTA typically presented with nephrocalcinosis (80%), as well as poor weight gain and failure to thrive (86%), and medical treatment included sodium bicarbonate and potassium replacement. Despite nephrocalcinosis progression, most patients had normal renal function (53%), although the remaining 47% progressed to chronic kidney disease (none reached ESKD). CONCLUSION: Childhood nephrolithiasis is mainly related to metabolic disorders and is associated with poor renal outcomes. Nephrocalcinosis and nephrolithiasis have poor outcomes when associated with FHHNC, while nephrocalcinosis associated with dRTA has relatively good renal outcomes.

AB  - The urinary excretion of silicon in the rat was found to be enhanced beyond normal levels by the administration of various chemical forms of silicon. The excretion was enhanced to a much greater degree by the administration of ethyl silicate than by magnesium trisilicate, sodium metasilicate, or water glass. The tolerance level of rats to sustained daily doses of ethyl silicate fed via stomach tube was approximately 15 to 30 mg. of silicon per rat per day. Urinary silicon excretion was found to be a straight line function of the concentration of ethyl silicate administered, via stomach tube, with approximately 18 per cent of the administered silicon appearing in the urine at all levels tested. Using sustained dietary additions of ethyl silicate as a means of enhancing urine silicon levels, artificial siliceous urinary calculi were consistently produced on zinc pellets implanted in the bladders of rats.

AB  - Two West Indian manatees (Trichechus manatus spp.) were reported with severe emaciation. One animal was a Florida manatee from the Everglades; the other was an Antillean manatee from Cuba. On necropsy, both animals had nephrolithiasis, pyelonephritis, and moderate to severe renomegaly. Histopathology revealed multifocal to diffuse pyelonephritis, interstitial nephritis, and nephrocalcinosis. The stones were analyzed and consisted primarily of calcium carbonate. Serum chemistry values for the Florida animal revealed no renal abnormalities. The mechanism of calculus formation remains unclear in manatees. In horses, another hindgut fermenter, the most common urolith is also calcium carbonate. Urinalyses performed on manatees are very similar to those of horses (i.e., alkaline urine, low specific gravity, and calcium carbonate crystals). Formation of uroliths in manatees may have a pathogenesis similar to equine urolithiasis.

AB  - The serum and 24 hour urinary excretion levels of various lithogenic and inhibitory substances were assessed in 24 male patients with calcium stone and no previous history of urolithiasis and in 19 age-matched controls. Two groups did not differ significantly (P < 0.01) except in the excretions of sodium, citric acid (being higher in normals) and inorganic phosphate (being higher in patients). Fifty percent patients had hyperphosphaturia, 29.2% hypocitraturia, 20.8% hyperoxaluria and 16.7% hypercalciuria. The present data suggests that hypocitraturia in association with phosphaturia might be one of the main risk factors responsible for calcium urolithiasis in this area.

AB  - Patients with crystalluric nephrolithiasis were treated orally with aqueous potassium citrate solution three times a day with a large quantity of water. After administration of potassium citrate, citric acid (P < 0.001) and potassium (P < 0.001) excretion was significantly increased. Increase in protein (P < 0.05) and uric acid (P < 0.05) excretion in urine revealed their association with the crystallization process. Crystals were absent in 12 (71%) out of 17 patients. Calcium excretion in urine was significantly decreased (P < 0.05). A decrease of calcium ions availability to oxalate ions to form calcium oxalate crystals may result in the prevention of calcium oxalate stone formation.

AB  - Calcium carbonate (CaCO3), or calcite, stones average 0.15% of annual nephrolithiasis cases. The authors report a 53 year old female, following a 15 year vegan diet, presenting with left flank pain and later found to have bilateral extensive staghorn renal calculi requiring multiple procedures over the course of months. Calcite stone formation is likely attributed to the patient's vegan diet and vitamin supplements. This stone's formation increases with neutral or alkaline urinary pH in the presence of high levels of magnesium. The authors discuss staged surgical treatment plans and non-surgical management prophylaxis with surgery as another possible route for treatment.

AB  - Six healthy adult cats were fed a basal minced beef meat and rice diet with varying amounts or combinations of acidifying and alkalizing additives (ammonium chloride, calcium and sodium carbonate). The base excess in the food (mmol/kg dry matter) was calculated (data on food compounds in g/kg dry matter) as follows: base excess = 49.9*Ca + 82.3*Mg + 43.5*Na + 25.6*K - 64.6*P - 13.4*Met-16.6*Cystine -28.2*Cl. It amounted to between +305 and -1079 mmol/kg dry matter. Urine and blood pH as well as balance of minerals and water were determined in the cats. The mean urine pH ranged between 6.1 and 7.8. There was a highly significant correlation between the base excess in the food and the mean urine pH. The regression line was linear down to a base excess in the diet of about -400 to -500 mmol/kg dry matter and a pH in the urine of 6.2. The postprandial increase of urine pH was suppressed either by large amounts of ammonium chloride (> 780 mmol/kg dry matter) alone or in combination with calcium carbonate, but not in combination with sodium carbonate. The relationship between the decrease of the blood pH and the amount of ammonium chloride added to the diet was more marked than the relationship between blood pH and base excess in the food. In order to avoid health risks by long term application of acidifying diets it is recommended to formulate struvite diets with low base excess in such a way, that they contain as few alkalizing compounds as possible, which must be neutralized by acidifiers.

AB  - Six healthy adult cats were fed a basal minced beef meat and rice diet (one meal per day) with varying amounts or combinations of acidifying and alkalizing additives (ammonium chloride, calcium and sodium carbonate). The base excess in the food (mmol/kg dry matter) was calculated (data on food compounds in g/kg dry matter) as follows: base excess = 49.9*Ca + 82.3*Mg + 43.5*Na + 25.6*K-64.6*P-13.4*met-16.6*cys-28.2*Cl. Base excess in the experimental diets amounted to between +305 and -1079 mmol/kg dry matter. After an adaptation period of 5 d, urine and blood pH as well as water and mineral balance were determined in the cats over a 10-15-d period. The daily mean urine pH ranged between 6.1 and 7.8. There was a highly significant correlation between the base excess in the food and the mean urine pH. The regression line was linear down to a base excess in the diet of approximately -400 to -500 mmol/kg dry matter and a pH in the urine of 6.2. The postprandial increase of urine pH was suppressed either by large amounts of ammonium chloride (> 780 mmol/kg dry matter) alone or in combination with calcium carbonate but not in combination with sodium carbonate.

AB  - Various stones were examined by a combined electron microscopy. Morphological parameters of calcium oxalates and phosphates, struvite, urates, cystine, gypsum, siliceous deposits in urinary, prostatic and salivary calculi, and calcium carbonate in gallstones were defined. Study also disclosed that stones frequently contain organic crystals in addition to the organic matrix. Membranous cell debris was observed in the nuclei of small stones and were believed to be common nidus of various stones. In view of a very limited number of crystals occurring in human stones, which differ obviously in their habits and growth patterns, an expeditious identification of stone components is possible by scanning electron microscopy. SEM with x-ray analysis is a powerful tool for research and diagnosis of various stones. It is most suitable for the study of surface phenomena, such as crystal growth, detection of phenomena, such as crystal growth, detection of organic matrix and minor components of the stones, and is a wide open field for a further study.

AB  - Silica calculi in man are extremely rare; only 12 cases have been reported. In an electron microscopic study of human urinary stones, siliceous deposits were encountered in three out of 180 stones as a discrete component of stones. There were no histories of magnesium trisilicate administration in these cases. Morphology of the deposits was distinctive from any other components of the stones and bore some resemblance to animal silica calculi. Siliceous deposits in human urinary stones appear to be more common than generally recognized.

AB  - This study deals with the role of the stone matrix substance in formation of urinary stones. A series of coagulation experiments were conducted by determining the sedimentation rate of calcium carbonate suspension with respect to the following substances: sodium alginate, stone matrix substance, bovine albumin and chondroitin sulfate C, these were each added to a separate fine particle suspension of calcium carbonate. Changes in zeta-potential of the suspension particles after addition of the above materials were determined microscopically using Usui's method. The results obtained in this study indicate that sodium alginate, the matrix substance, bovine albumin and chondroitin sulfate C act on the suspension particles, and as a result, coagulation is produced by a decrease of the zeta-potential of the particles. Application of kinetic energy to the coagulate caused by sodium alginate resulted in the formation of a solid. From these results it is considered that the matrix substance is not incorporated by accident in urinary stones, but it participates in the formation of them.

AB  - The present study was undertaken to determine if urinary protein can produce urinary stones and what types of protein have such an effect. Normal human serum was fractionated first with ammonium sulfate and then with DEAE-cellulose. The stone-forming action of each fraction was estimated by calculating their ability to alter the sedimentation rate and zeta-potential of a calcium carbonate suspension. Finally, the proteins in each fraction were identified by cellulose acetate electrophoresis. The most marked aggregating and precipitating effect on a CaCO3 suspension was observed with a mixture of proteins of alpha1-globulin and albumin fractions. However, beta- and gamma-fractions had little aggregating effect on the CaCO3 suspension.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe use of plain radiography for diagnosis, surgical management, and postoperative treatment of obstructive urolithiasis in small ruminants. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective case series. ANIMALS: Small ruminants (n = 27; 25 goats, 2 sheep). METHODS: Medical records (January 2002-November 2011) and radiographs for all small ruminants diagnosed with obstructive urolithiasis and having plain abdominal radiographs were reviewed. Signalment, surgical procedures, radiographic findings, ultrasonographic findings, position of calculi, and how plain radiography influenced surgical management and postoperative treatment were recorded. RESULTS: Radiopaque urinary calculi were detected in 23 (85%) plain radiographic studies. Location of uroliths determined by plain radiography included: cystic only (n = 5), distal to the sigmoid flexure and cystic (5), subischial (5), distal to the sigmoid flexure only (3), sigmoid flexure (3), and subischial and cystic (2). In 8 of these animals, postoperative radiographs revealed residual calculi in the urethra and were essential for their targeted removal by urethrotomy in 7 animals. CONCLUSIONS: In regions where radiopaque calculi (calcium carbonate, calcium oxalate, silica) are commonly encountered in small ruminants, plain radiographs are recommended to determine the appropriate surgical approach(es) and to confirm resolution of the obstruction.

AB  - INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: Prostate stones are frequently encountered during transurethral resection of the prostate in urology practice. We aimed to demonstrate the physical and chemical properties of prostate stones. We also aimed to determine possible relationship between inflammation of prostate gland and prostate stones. METHODS: The consecutive patients (excluding subjects with PSA>or=4ng/ml and urolithiasis), who underwent TURP operation and who were observed to have prostatic calculi during TURP, were included in the study. The prostatic stones obtained from each patient during TURP were analysed for chemical composition and observed under electron microscopy (SEM) for structure and surface morphology. The pathological specimens were assessed by the uropathologist for the final diagnosis and existence and degree of inflammation. RESULTS: Five patients were included in the study. From each patient at least three (range 3-8) samples of stones (diameter varying from 1mm up to 5mm) were obtained. The stones were made of mixed composition of calcium phosphate and calcium carbonate. The stones were found to have lobular surface made up of small spheres under SEM. Histopathological examination of the TURP specimens revealed being prostatic hyperplasia accompanied with inflammation of mild to severe degree. CONCLUSIONS: Prostatic stones are concentrically precipitated calcium stones within the prostatic ductuli with granular grape like morphology. Histopathological inflammation seems to be associated with these prostatic calculi.

AB  - This project sought to test the ability of commercial stone analysis laboratories to correctly analyze urinary stones. Human stone specimens were cleaved into pieces, and the pieces of each specimen were verified as being similar using micro-computed tomography (micro CT), a non-destructive method. Thus, similar specimens from 25 stones were sent to five laboratories, and a sixth piece was kept for analysis in our laboratory using Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). The results showed that laboratories were very good at analyzing pure specimens, but with mixed specimens the accuracy and consistency varied. In six stones containing apatite, a mineral easily identified using micro CT, apatite was missed 20% of the time. Struvite content in the specimens was inconsistently reported, with laboratories differing in their reports of the presence of struvite in six of the 25 stones (24%). A mixed stone containing atazanavir was not reported by any of the laboratories as containing that drug. Nomenclature differed among the laboratories, especially with regard to apatite, which was variously reported as hydroxyapatite, carbonate apatite, or as apatite with calcium carbonate. One laboratory reported protein in every stone, while for all others protein was reported in only one stone. We conclude that physicians need to be aware that reports on mixed stones, which represent >90% of all calculi, can be erroneous. It is likely that supplying a greater amount of stone material will assist a laboratory in making a correct analysis of mixed stones. Also, standardization of nomenclature could assist in analysis reproducibility, but this remains to be tested.

AB  - PURPOSE: We determined the accuracy of stone composition analysis at commercial laboratories. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 25 human renal stones with infrared spectroscopy determined composition were fragmented into aliquots and studied with micro computerized tomography to ensure fragment similarity. Representative fragments of each stone were submitted to 5 commercial stone laboratories for blinded analysis. RESULTS: All laboratories agreed on the composition of 6 pure stones. Only 2 of 4 stones (50%) known to contain struvite were identified as struvite at all laboratories. Struvite was reported as a component by some laboratories for 4 stones previously determined not to contain struvite. Overall there was disagreement regarding struvite in 6 stones (24%). For 9 calcium oxalate stones all laboratories reported some mixture of calcium oxalate but the quantity of subtypes differed significantly among laboratories. In 6 apatite containing stones apatite was missed by the laboratories in 20% of samples. None of the laboratories identified atazanavir in a stone containing that antiviral drug. One laboratory reported protein in every sample while all others reported it in only 1. Nomenclature for apatite differed among laboratories with 1 reporting apatite as carbonate apatite and never hydroxyapatite, another never reporting carbonate apatite and always reporting hydroxyapatite, and a third reporting carbonate apatite as apatite with calcium carbonate. CONCLUSIONS: Commercial laboratories reliably recognize pure calculi. However, variability in the reporting of mixed calculi suggests a problem with the accuracy of stone analysis results. There is also a lack of standard nomenclature used by laboratories.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Urolithiasis in small ruminants has a poor long-term prognosis, and long-term clinical outcomes are variable and unpredictable. OBJECTIVES: To assess the accuracy of preoperative and postoperative blood l-lactate concentrations in predicting a negative outcome in goats undergoing tube cystostomy. ANIMALS: Thirty-four male goats undergoing tube cystostomy. METHODS: Retrospective study. Medical records of goats undergoing tube cystostomy from 2015 to 2020 were reviewed. Clinical variables recorded included signalment, procedures before surgery, urolith location and type, duration of hospitalization, and heart rate. PCV, plasma total protein, potassium, preoperative and postoperative blood l-lactate concentrations, preoperative and postoperative creatinine concentrations, and relative changes in blood l-lactate and creatinine concentrations over time were measured using heparinized blood. A negative outcome was defined as death or euthanasia from urolithiasis complications at 6 months after discharge. Negative outcomes as a function of independent clinical variables were evaluated using chi(2) or Fisher's exact tests, and multivariate logistic regression. P < .05 was considered significant. RESULTS: Median (95% confidence interval) preoperative, postoperative, and the relative change over time of blood l-lactate concentrations were 3.3 mmol/L (2.2, 4.8), 1.0 mmol/L (0.7, 1.3), and 0.4 mmol/L (-3.5, 3.2), respectively. Preoperative (P = 1), postoperative (P = .14), and the relative change over time (P = .63) of blood l-lactate concentrations were not significant predictors of a negative outcome. Furthermore, all other clinical variables measured were not significant predictors of a negative outcome (P > .05). CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Veterinarians should advise clients that clinical outcomes after tube cystostomy in goats are likely unpredictable.

AB  - Urolithiasis in children occurs with the incidence of 0.1-5%. Risk factors such as metabolic disorders, recurrent urinary tract infections and/or congenital abnormalities of urinary tract are detected in 75-85% of children with urolithiasis. Staghorn calculi is associated with delayed diagnosis and treatment of urinary tract infection caused by specific organisms, which produce the enzyme urease, promoting generation of ammonia and hydroxide from urea. We present two boys with staghorn calculi recognized in 8th and 31st month of age. The reason for performing ultrasonography was urinary tract infection in both boys. The younger child was previously healthy, with no symptoms of urolithiasis, the older one had recurrent urinary tract infections caused by Proteus mirabilis, episodes of anxiety and abdominal pain. Laboratory test and imaging studies excluded congenital abnormalities in the urinary tract and typical metabolic causes of urolithiasis in both boys. Treatment of infection-related stones in the younger child included two extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy (ESWL). In the older child, both ESWL and operation were performed. Staghorn calculi were composed of mixtures of magnesium ammonium phosphate (struvite) and calcium carbonate (apatite) and confirmed to be identified as infection-related stones. During follow-up in a nephrology outpatient clinic, values of blood pressure, renal ultrasonography, kidney function test were normal and no symptoms of urinary tract infections were clinically present. In patients with recurrent urinary tract infections, urolithiasis should be taken into consideration. The majority of staghorn calculi is often asymptomatic and can be diagnosed with an ultrasonography study performed routine or during urinary tract infection.

AB  - A captive 5-yr-old castrated male Rocky Mountain wapiti (Cervus elaphus nelsoni) developed stranguria. Rectal palpation and physical examination indicated urethral obstruction that was subsequently relieved by urethrostomy and required only minimal aftercare. The wapiti was able to urinate freely after surgery; however, the obstruction recurred 27 mo later. Urethral catheterization relieved the second obstruction, which was caused by a large calculus composed of calcium carbonate and magnesium carbonate. Urolithiasis may have been associated with a diet high in calcium, and urethral obstruction may have been associated with castration at an early age. The wapiti continued to urinate freely 9 mo after relief of the second obstruction and 3 yr after the initial surgery.

AB  - Dissolution of uric acid calculi could be obtained by oral or parenteral urinary alcalinization, but this method cannot apply to the case of obstructive calculi. Nineteen obstructive calculi in 18 patients were treated by in situ alcalinization through a percutaneous nephrostomy catheter (PCN). Eight patients were initially anuric, 7 of whom from an obstructed solitary kidney and 1 from a bilateral obstructive lithiasis. Fifteen calculi were located in the ureter, 3 in the uretero-pelvic junction and 1 in the pelvis. After 48 h of urinary diversion through PCN, an isotonic sodium bicarbonate solution (14 g %) was continuously infused at an average flow rate of 2.8 l/24 h, through either an unique PCN, or a 2 PCN-irrigation circuit in the 7 cases with permanently obstructive calculus. Fifteen calculi (80%) were completely dissolved after 3 to 13 days of alcalinization (average 5.8 days). One large calculus was reduced by 3/4 and further removed by percutaneous lithotripsy. Three patients underwent ureterotomy after 9 to 11 days of uneffective treatment. Local alcalinization is an effective and non invasive treatment for obstructive uric acid calculi, and is logically associated with the necessary urinary diversion.

AB  - Intravenous pyelography (IVP), retrograde ureteral catheterization and percutaneous nephrostomy (PCN) have been used to locate radiolucent stones during ESWL in an X-ray localization system lithotripter. We also used an alternative method combining PCN, ESWL and chemolysis to treat 8 obstructive uric acid stones. The average number of shock wave pulses was 1,725 (range 1,000-2,000), the generator voltage of the HM-3 Dornier lithotripter was 20-22 kV, and the local chemolysis lasted 4 days (range 2-7). All radiolucent uric acid stones were successfully disintegrated. Of the 8 patients treated, 5 were completely free of stones and the other 3 had insignificant residual stones after 3 months. Three patients who developed fever during local chemolysis with 0.1 M sodium bicarbonate solution were managed conservatively without severe sequelae. Only 1 patient retained a PCN tube after discharge. Because PCN can provide a path for local chemolysis and better localization, it is especially helpful in treating obstructive uric acid stones.

AB  - We report a case of a 30-year-old female who had a long-term history of trisilicate-containing antacid intake for gastric discomfort. She had experienced repeated attacks of renal colic. Neither intravenous pyelography nor ureteroscopy could define the presence of calculi. The metabolic evaluations were normal. However, X-ray diffraction revealed a silicate stone. We suggest that the attack of renal colic in those patients with long-term history of trisilicate intake should arouse the possibility of silica urolithiasis.

AB  - Idiopathic hypercalciuria, defined as the urinary excretion of more than 300 mg. calcium per day in men or more than 250 mg. calcium per day in women, or more than 4 mg. calcium per kg. per day, is observed in about 50 per cent of the patients with calcium oxalate/apatite nephrolithiasis and is one of the risk factors for stone formation. These patients do not exhibit hypercalcemia, elevated serum parathyroid hormone concentrations or urinary cyclic adenosine monophosphate excretion nor clinical evidence of sarcoidosis, other granulomas or a malignancy. Hypophosphatemia may be present. Augmented rates of intestinal absorption of dietary calcium account for most of the increments in urinary calcium. Serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D concentrations are in the upper normal range or elevated among many patients and are normal but not suppressed in the others. Activation of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D formation may be secondary to hypophosphatemia or other, as yet undefined, factors. Since, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D apparently can up-regulate its own receptor, small increments in its synthesis and blood levels could amplify the effect of the hormone to stimulate intestinal calcium absorption. Calcium balances are slightly but significantly negative and urinary hydroxyproline excretion may be increased so that a generalized disorder of calcium homeostasis also involving bone may be present. Additional studies are required to determine the genetic basis for the occurrence of idiopathic hypercalciuria in families, the cause of greater expression of idiopathic hypercalciuria in men and whether environmental factors (high dietary sodium chloride, protein and purified carbohydrate intakes) contribute to the expression of idiopathic hypercalciuria. Although thiazide diuretics, inorganic phosphate, magnesium hydroxide and potassium citrate have provided effective therapy, prospective studies are needed to determine optimum therapy and the optimum duration of treatment.

AB  - Uric acid stone is the most comment radiolucent renal stone with high recurrence rate, which would further cause acute upper urinary tract obstruction and kidney failure. Here we report two cases of renal uric acid stone from December 2012 to April 2013. One 43-year-old male patient suffered from chronic uric acid nephrolithiasis caused by the long-term indwelling of bilateral double-J stent. Another 69-year-old patient was also diagnosed with uric acid nephrolithiasis at the right kidney. Both patients were first treated with extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL), followed by 1.5% sodium bicarbonate dissolution therapy. After a week of the treatment, the uric acid stones in both patients were completely dissolved without retrograde infection. In summary, the use of ESWL and sodium bicarbonate dissolution therapy as a combined modality is a safe, effective, inexpensive treatment for uric acid nephrolithiasis.

AB  - PURPOSE: Urinary oxalate is a primary determinant of the level of calcium oxalate saturation and the formation of calcium oxalate crystals, a key event in kidney stone formation. The primary objective of this study was to compare the effects of calcium carbonate and magnesium oxide on oxalate absorption. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An experimental model was used that allowed differentiation between endogenously and oxalate load-derived urinary oxalate. Twenty-four healthy subjects (10 males, 14 females) participated in three oxalate load (OL) tests: control (OL alone), calcium carbonate (OL with concomitant calcium carbonate ingestion), and magnesium oxide (OL with concomitant magnesium oxide ingestion). Oxalate loads consisted of 180 mg. unlabeled and 18 mg. 1,2[13C2] oxalic acid. Timed urine samples were collected after the OL for analysis of oxalate, calcium, magnesium, and creatinine. RESULTS: Both the calcium carbonate and magnesium oxide treatments were associated with significantly lower load-derived oxalate levels at all time points within the initial 24-hour post-oxalate ingestion period compared with levels observed for the control treatment. There were no treatment effects on endogenous oxalate levels. The efficiency of oxalate absorption for the calcium carbonate (5.1%) and magnesium oxide (7.6%) treatments was significantly lower than that for the control treatment (13.5%). CONCLUSIONS: The results suggested that magnesium was nearly as effective as calcium in reducing oxalate absorption and urinary excretion. Higher levels of urinary oxalate, calcium, and magnesium in males appeared to be largely a function of body size since gender differences either disappeared or were reversed when a correction was made for urinary creatinine excretion.

AB  - A 6-yr-old male red kangaroo (Macropus rufus) presented for a history of inappetance, abnormal behavior, and unconfirmed elimination for 6 hr prior to presentation. Based on abdominal ultrasound, abdominocentesis, and cystocentesis, a presumptive diagnosis of urinary tract obstruction with uroabdomen and hydronephrosis was reached. Abdominal radiographs did not assist in reaching an antemortem diagnosis. Postmortem examination confirmed a urinary bladder rupture secondary to urethral obstruction by a single urethrolith. Bilateral hydronephrosis and hydroureter were identified and determined to be a result of bilateral ureteroliths. Urolith analysis revealed a composition of 100% calcium carbonate. A dietary analysis was performed, implicating an increased Ca:P ratio from a food preparation miscommunication as a contributing factor. Appropriate husbandry changes were made, and mob surveillance procedures were performed, which resolved the urolithiasis risk for the remaining five animals.

AB  - Urolithiasis is a well-known disease of the urogenital system in domestic animals, and it has also been described in captive and free-ranging wildlife. This article reports 15 cases of urolithiasis in a captive group of Tammar wallabies (Macropus eugenii) between 2004 and 2011. The analyzed stones were composed of pure calcium carbonate (n = 5), calcium carbonate with traces of calcium phosphate (n = 6), carbonate apatite (n = 2), and carbonate apatite mixed with calcium oxalate (n = 2). In 12 out of 15 cases uroliths were situated only in the renal pelvis; in two cases they were found in the renal pelvis and the ureter; while in one case in the ureter only. No common infectious agents were identified either by microbiological or histopathological methods. Although the exact cause remains unknown, the repetitive occurrence of calcium carbonate urolithiasis suggests husbandry-related causes. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first report on recurrent appearance of urolithiasis in a captive group of Tammar wallabies.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Urolithiasis is one of the most common urological diseases, and its incidence has increased globally in recent years. Multiple potential mechanisms are involved in urolithiasis, including renal oxidative stress, inflammatory response, fibrosis, pyroptosis, and gut microbiota disturbance. Sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO(3)) is commonly used clinically to alkalize urine and slow the progression of chronic kidney disease, including urolithiasis. However, the specific mechanism of NaHCO(3) in the treatment of urolithiasis is unclear. METHODS: In this study, we constructed a mice urolithiasis model via intraperitoneal injection of glyoxylate (50 mg/kg) for one week in C57BL/6 mice. Meanwhile, 5% NaHCO(3) was added to drinking water in the treatment group. Biochemical detection, immunohistochemical staining, RT-qPCR, and Western blotting were used to assess kidney function and levels of inflammation and pyroptosis. The alteration of gut microbiota in mice treated with NaHCO(3) was measured using 16S rDNA sequencing. RESULTS: The results demonstrated that NaHCO(3) effectively reduced the deposition of CaOx crystal, as well as restored kidney function in urolithiasis-induced kidney injury mice. Moreover, NaHCO(3) alleviated oxidative stress and inflammatory response and ameliorated pyroptosis by modulating the NLRP3 inflammasome pathway in kidney. Additionally, it enhanced the intestinal barrier function by up-regulating the expression of tight junction proteins (ZO-1, occludin, and claudin 5), remodeling the gut microbiota, and reducing intestinal inflammation. CONCLUSION: In summary, NaHCO(3) exerted a protective effect via the gut-kidney axis in the urolithiasis mice model, suggesting its potential use as a dietary supplementation to be added to daily drinking water for the management of urolithiasis.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Several therapeutic modalities for the prevention of calcium oxalate (CaOx) stones have been studied, but only a select few of these modalities have been incorporated into the American Urological Association guidelines. Our study aimed to organize and interrogate existing research that may be promising for CaOx prevention. METHODS: A literature search was conducted using MEDLINE and Embase from inception to November 16, 2022. Our study population included adults with or without a history of CaOx kidney stones. Studies in which patients were treated with pharmacotherapies, herbal supplements, or uncategorized research chemicals that are not included in the current American Urological Association guidelines for preventing CaOx stones were included. Nonoriginal research was excluded. RESULTS: Out of the 6155 identified articles, 38 were included in the final analysis. The five distinct categories of interventions for stone prevention were "medications", "herbal supplements", "food and macronutrients", "micronutrients", and "enzymes and probiotics". Modalities that were found to reduce known urinary risk factors were tolvaptan, cranberry juice, magnesium citrate, oxalate-degrading enzyme ALLN-177, and malic acid. Prophylaxis that reduced stone formation were sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors, eicosapentaenoic acid, ethane-1-hydroxy-1,1-disphosphonate. Therapies that reduced urinary risk factors and stone formation were Phyllanthus niruri, rice bran, and magnesium hydroxide. CONCLUSION: Several of the identified therapies may provide prophylactic benefits for CaOx stone formation and may be useful for inclusion in guidelines for kidney stone prevention.

AB  - Administration of thiazide diuretics has been recommended to prevent calcium oxalate urolith development in dogs. To evaluate the effects of thiazide diuretics in dogs, 24-hour urine excretion of calcium was measured in 6 clinically normal Beagles after administration of chlorothiazide (CTZ) for 2 weeks, administration of CTZ for 10 weeks, and administration of calcium carbonate and CTZ for 2 weeks. Compared with baseline values, 24-hour urine calcium excretion did not decrease after CTZ administration. When CTZ was given at a high dosage (130 mg/kg of body weight), urinary calcium excretion was significantly (P < 0.04) higher than baseline values. Based on these observations, we do not recommend CTZ for treatment or prevention of canine calcium oxalate urolithiasis.

AB  - Urolithiasis in sows and neonatal pigs is well-known, but information on its occurrence and impact in finishing pigs is sparse. This study reports three outbreaks of urolithiasis in finishing pigs. In one herd, no symptoms were observed, whereas in the other herds the presence of calculi caused obstruction of the urinary tract resulting in death. Using infra-red spectroscopy, the predominant mineral-type found in the uroliths was calcium carbonate (calcite). Only small amounts of calcium oxalate (< 1%) could be detected. A high urinary pH, small abnormalities in the mineral composition of the feed and insufficient drinking water were the most important risk factors identified. To prevent urolithiasis, it is important to ensure adequate water intake, to provide a balanced mineral diet, and to avoid urinary tract infections.

AB  - Following the introduction of one or two percutaneous nephrostomy drains, 16 obstructive uric acid calculi were treated by perfusion of excretory cavities with 14% sodium bicarbonate solution. Twelve calculi had dissolved within an average of 5 days, 1 required percutaneous lithotripsy because of incomplete dissolution and 3 were unaltered. Success of this treatment appears to be dependent on the total radiotransparency of calculi, a feature difficult to demonstrate. There were no reports of major complications. The only weakly invasive nature of alkalinization in situ makes it a method of choice to be reserved for obstructive calculi, and a therapeutic strategy is proposed.

AB  - X-ray diffraction crystallography was used to determine the crystalline composition of 18 equine urinary calculi, including stones originating in the kidney, bladder and urethra. Calcium carbonate in the form of calcite was found to be the major component in all calculi examined. Other components commonly found included weddellite and substituted vaterite. Urine deposits from a number of normal horses were also examined. The significance of these findings, as well as those from a number of previous reports, are discussed in relation to the possible aetiology of urolithiasis in the horse.

AB  - Topiramate is an anticonvulsant that is labeled for the management of several seizure types in children >2 years of age. With the exception of cognitive dysfunction, nephrolithiasis, weight loss, and paresthesia, adverse effects in children are similar to other those noted with other anticonvulsants. We describe a 33-month-old child with complex partial seizures and secondary generalization who received topiramate 45 mg orally twice daily (6.2 mg/kg/d) for approximately 4 weeks before admission. He developed asymptomatic metabolic acidosis that was evidenced by a decrease in HCO(3) (-), which was unresponsive to treatment with sodium bicarbonate. The child was weaned off topiramate and the metabolic acidosis resolved 48 hours after its discontinuation.

AB  - Wet chemical tests have deficiencies when applied to mixtures containing silica, which are common in the uroliths of some domestic animals. Consequently, the applicability of an infrared spectroscopic method was tested on 104 uroliths obtained from cattle, sheep, goats, horses, pigs, dogs, a chicken and a rabbit during diagnostic investigations. The following components were satisfactorily identified: silica, calcium oxalate, calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate, magnesium ammonium phosphate, magnesium phosphate and urates. The infrared characteristics of these compounds and their mixtures are described.

AB  - Infected kidney stones refer to stones that form because of urinary tract infections with urease-producing bacteria, secondarily infected stones of any composition, or stones obstructing the urinary tract leading to pyelonephritis. The mainstay of treatment of infection stones is complete stone removal. Kidney stones that obstruct the urinary tract and cause obstructive pyelonephritis are also frequently referred to as infected stones. Obstructive pyelonephritis is a urologic emergency as it can result in sepsis and even death. Infection stones and obstructive stones causing pyelonephritis are different disease processes, and their workup and management are described separately.

AB  - Recent evidence suggests a role for nanobacteria in a growing number of human diseases, including renal stone formation, cardiovascular diseases, and cancer. This large body of research studies promotes the view that nanobacteria are not only alive but that they are associated with disease pathogenesis. However, it is still unclear whether they represent novel life forms, overlooked nanometer-size bacteria, or some other primitive self-replicating microorganisms. Here, we report that CaCO(3) precipitates prepared in vitro are remarkably similar to purported nanobacteria in terms of their uniformly sized, membrane-delineated vesicular shapes, with cellular division-like formations and aggregations in the form of colonies. The gradual appearance of nanobacteria-like particles in incubated human serum as well as the changes seen with their size and shape can be influenced and explained by introducing varying levels of CO(2) and NaHCO(3) as well as other conditions known to influence the precipitation of CaCO(3). Western blotting reveals that the monoclonal antibodies, claimed to be specific for nanobacteria, react in fact with serum albumin. Furthermore, nanobacteria-like particles obtained from human blood are able to withstand high doses of gamma-irradiation up to 30 kGy, and no bacterial DNA is found by performing broad-range PCR amplifications. Collectively, our results provide a more plausible abiotic explanation for the unusual properties of purported nanobacteria.

AB  - We observed earlier that mineralo-organic nanoparticles form in human body fluids when the concentrations of calcium, carbonate and phosphate exceed saturation. The particles have been shown to represent mineral precursors in developing bones and teeth as well as in ectopic calcification and kidney stones. Recent studies suggest that the mineral particles may also be involved in other physiological processes, including immune tolerance against the gut microbiota and food antigens. We review here the involvement of mineralo-organic nanoparticles in physiological and pathological processes and discuss recent findings that reveal novel and unexpected roles for these particles in the human body.

AB  - CASE DESCRIPTION: A 5-year-old 2.23-kg (4.91-lb) spayed female Lop rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) was evaluated because of a history of lethargy, polyuria, and polydipsia of 1 month's duration. The referring veterinarian made a presumptive diagnosis of hypercalcemia of unknown etiology on the basis of a plasma total calcium concentration of 14.0 mg/dL. CLINICAL FINDINGS: Physical examination findings were unremarkable. Hematologic and plasma biochemical analysis revealed nonregenerative, normocytic, normochromic anemia (PCV, 28%) with heteropenia (23%; 1,334 heterophils/mL) and a total plasma calcium concentration of 16 mg/dL. Radiographic and ultrasonographic examination revealed radiodense and hyperechoic structures in both renal pelves and right unilateral nephrolithiasis. TREATMENT AND OUTCOME: Nephrotomy was performed via laparotomy with a right lateral approach. A nephrolith composed of calcium carbonate and carbonate apatite was removed from the right renal pelvis. The rabbit's plasma tested positive for antibodies against Encephalitozoon cuniculi by means of an indirect immunofluorescence assay, and fenbendazole (20 mg/kg [9.1 mg/lb], p.o., q 24 h) was administered for 28 days. Although plasma calcium concentration was not substantially decreased after treatment (values were 14.1 and 15.1 mg/dL 1 week and 3 months after surgery, respectively), the patient did not have clinical signs of hypercalcemia and died of unrelated causes approximately 1 year after surgery. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: To the authors' knowledge, this is the first report of a nephrotomy performed in a rabbit via a lateral abdominal approach. This approach allowed easy location of the kidney and also reduced manipulation, thus decreasing the risk of damaging the abdominal viscera and potentially decreasing postoperative pain.

AB  - Urinary calculi may be induced by a number of medications used to treat a variety of conditions. These medications may lead to metabolic abnormalities that facilitate the formation of stones. Drugs that induce metabolic calculi include loop diuretics; carbonic anhydrase inhibitors; and laxatives, when abused. Correcting the metabolic abnormality may eliminate or dramatically attenuate stone activity. Urinary calculi can also be induced by medications when the drugs crystallize and become the primary component of the stones. In this case, urinary supersaturation of the agent may promote formation of the calculi. Drugs that induce calculi via this process include magnesium trisilicate; ciprofloxacin; sulfa medications; triamterene; indinavir; and ephedrine, alone or in combination with guaifenesin. When this situation occurs, discontinuation of the medication is usually necessary.

AB  - Formation of calculi in efferent urinary passages is always due to supersaturation of urinary calculi substances and associated increased crystallization. Apart from the typical calculi, consisting of calcium oxalate, inorganic phosphates, uric acid or cystine, there are occasional signs of rare substance classes. Although more than 50 silicate stones have already been reported internationally, this stone entity remains relatively unknown. In particular, the occurrence of silicate stones in the absence of magnesium trisilicate abuse is extremely rare. A medium-sized left-sided ureterolith was removed from a 54-year-old male patient using a ureteroscope. X-ray diffraction showed it to be a compound stone consisting of 40% silicate. The patient, who in 1986 was living close to the nuclear reactor accident in Chernobyl, showed no signs of a constant uptake of magnesium trisilicate. However, he had undergone partial (2/3) gastrectomy 4 months before for a drug-refractory gastric ulcer, which had been diagnosed at the end of the 1980s and treated with excessive dosages of a magnesium trisilicate antacid preparation until the time of the operation. The patient had also been suffering from unstable angina pectoris since 1986 and treated with Pentalong (pentaerythrityltetranitrate) for 17 years. We were also able to detect silicium dioxide in components of this drug using X-ray diffraction. Silicate uroliths are extremely rare but they can be clearly identified by X-ray diffraction or infrared spectroscopy and distinguished from artifacts or quartz pebbles. Formation of calculi can be prevented by increasing diuresis as well as switching to a different drug and reducing the dosage.

AB  - PURPOSE: Conventional therapy (calcium and activated vitamin D) does not restore calcium homeostasis in patients with chronic hypoparathyroidism (HypoPT) and is associated with renal complications and reduced quality of life (QoL). The aim of this study was to evaluate in a case-control, cross-sectional study, the rate of renal complications and QoL in two sex- and age-matched cohort of patients with differentiated thyroid cancer with (n = 89) and without (n = 89) chronic post-operative HypoPT (PoHypoPT) and their relationship with the biochemical control of the disease. METHODS: Serum and urinary parameters, renal ultrasound and QoL were assessed by SF-36 and WHO-5 questionnaires. RESULTS: Forty-three (48.3%) PoHypoPT patients reported symptoms of hypocalcemia. Twenty-six (29.2%) patients were at target for all 6 parameters, 46 (51.6%) for 5. The most frequently unmet targets were gender-specific 24-h urinary calcium (44.9%) and serum calcium (37.1%). Serum phosphate, magnesium and 25(OH)D were in the normal range in > 90% of patients. Renal calcifications were found in 26 (29.2%) patients, with no correlation with 24-h urinary calcium. eGFR did not differ between patients and controls. Conversely, patients had a significant higher rate of renal calcifications and a lower SF-36, but not WHO-5, scores. SF-36 scores did not differ between PoHypoPT patients who were, or not, hypocalcemic. CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that the rate of renal calcifications was higher in patients with PoHypoPT than in those without. This finding, together with the reduced QoL and the presence of hypocalcemic symptoms in about half patients, underscores that the treatment of chronic HypoPT with conventional therapy is suboptimal.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To report a rare case of tertiary hyperparathyroidism (HPT) as a result of long-term oral phosphate therapy. METHODS: We present a case report, with a focus on clinical manifestations and biochemical findings during the course of tertiary HPT, and discuss the pathophysiologic features of this disorder and the therapeutic strategies. RESULTS: A 35-year-old woman, 22 years after the initial diagnosis of familial hypophosphatemic rickets and initiation of treatment with phosphate and vitamin D, underwent assessment for recurrent symptomatic kidney stones, bone pain, and fatigue. Laboratory studies performed 10 months before this presentation showed findings consistent with secondary HPT. Examination was notable for short stature, and pertinent laboratory results were as follows: intact parathyroid hormone 602 pg/mL, calcium 10.9 mg/dL, and phosphorus 3.6 mg/dL. Tertiary HPT was diagnosed, and she underwent subtotal parathyroidectomy and transcervical thymectomy. Postoperatively, she had hypocalcemia and was treated with calcitriol, phosphate, and calcium carbonate; the last agent was discontinued when the serum calcium normalized. Despite multiple dosage alterations in the phosphate and calcitriol therapy, the patient had recurrent tertiary HPT and another kidney stone (treated by lithotripsy). Three years after the subtotal parathyroidectomy, treatment consisted of cinacalcet, calcitriol, and elemental phosphate. CONCLUSION: Long-term follow-up of patients with tertiary HPT is critical, with careful dosage adjustments in phosphate and vitamin D therapy and monitoring of serum levels of phosphorus, calcium, and parathyroid hormone.

AB  - Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is a common endocrine condition which disrupts physiologic calcium regulation. PHPT causes persistent hypercalcemia via the elevated and constant secretion of parathyroid hormone. Due to the effects of parathyroid hormone on target organs such as the bones, kidneys and gastrointestinal tract, untreated PHPT can lead to complications such as decreased bone mineral density, nephrolithiasis, and chronic abdominal pain, respectively. Given PHPT's drastic effect on calcium metabolism, it is likely that the condition also affects other organ systems, such as the inner ear, which rely on calcium for normal structure and function. Specifically, the saccule and utricle have otoconia made of calcium carbonate deposited on a protein framework. We hypothesize that PHPT, the epitome calcium disorder, can cause otoconia degeneration, one manifestation of which is benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). As a preliminarily test of this hypothesis, we measured the levels of otolin-1, an inner ear glycoprotein found in the otoconia protein framework and a proposed biomarker for otoconia degeneration in patients with PHPT. We found a positive linear relationship between PTH (parathyroid hormone) and otolin-1 levels (R(2) = 0.53) and total calcium and PTH levels (R(2) = 0.32). These findings suggest that both PTH and total calcium levels affect otolin-1 levels, implying that the calcium dysregulation caused by PHPT may contribute to the otoconia breakdown and may be associated with inner ear disorders such as BPPV.

AB  - A randomized, placebo-controlled trial was conducted in overweight calcium stone-forming (CSF) patients, to evaluate the effect of calcium supplementation associated with a calorie-restricted diet on body weight (BW) and fat reduction and its potential changes upon serum and urinary parameters. Fifteen patients were placed on a hypocaloric diet for 3 months, supplemented with either calcium carbonate (CaCO(3), n = 8) or placebo (n = 7), 500 mg bid. Blood and 24-h urine samples were collected and body composition was assessed at baseline and after the intervention. At the end of the study, final BW was significantly lower vs baseline in both CaCO(3) (74 +/- 14 vs. 80 +/- 14 kg, P = 0.01) and placebo groups (80 +/- 10 vs. 87 +/- 9 kg, P = 0.02) but the mean percentage of loss of body weight and body fat did not differ between CaCO(3) and placebo (7.0 +/- 2.0 vs. 8.0 +/- 3.0%, P = 0.40 and 13.0 +/- 7.0 vs. 13.0 +/- 10.0%; P = 0.81, respectively). After CaCO(3) or placebo, no significant differences versus baseline were observed for urinary parameters in both CaCO(3) and placebo, except for a higher mean urinary citrate in placebo group. These data suggest that increasing calcium intake by calcium carbonate supplementation did not contribute to a further reduction of BW and fat in overweight CSF patients submitted to a hypocaloric diet nor altered urinary lithogenic parameters.

AB  - Nano- and microparticles enter the body through the respiratory airways and the digestive system, or form as biominerals in the gall bladder, salivary glands, urinary bladder, kidney, or diabetic pancreas. Calcium, magnesium, and phosphate ions can precipitate from biological fluids in the presence of mucin as hybrid nanoparticles. Calcium carbonate nanocrystallites also trap mucin and are assembled into hybrid microparticles. Both mucin and calcium carbonate polymorphs (calcite, aragonite, and vaterite) are known to be components of such biominerals as gallstones which provoke inflammatory reactions. Our study was aimed at evaluation of neutrophil activation by hybrid vaterite-mucin microparticles (CCM). Vaterite microparticles (CC) and CCM were prepared under standard conditions. The diameter of CC and CCM was 3.3 +/- 0.8 microm and 5.8 +/- 0.7 microm, with z-potentials of -1 +/- 1 mV and -7 +/- 1 mV, respectively. CC microparticles injured less than 2% of erythrocytes in 2 h at 1.5 mg mL(-1), and no hemolysis was detected with CCM; this let us exclude direct damage of cellular membranes by microparticles. Activation of neutrophils was analyzed by luminol- and lucigenin-dependent chemiluminescence (Lum-CL and Luc-CL), by cytokine gene expression (IL-6, IL-8, IL-10) and release (IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, TNF-alpha), and by light microscopy of stained smears. There was a 10-fold and higher increase in the amplitude of Lum-CL and Luc-CL after stimulation of neutrophils with CCM relative to CC. Adsorption of mucin onto prefabricated CC microparticles also contributed to activation of neutrophil CL, unlike mucin adsorption onto yeast cell walls (zymosan); adsorbed mucin partially suppressed zymosan-stimulated production of oxidants by neutrophils. Preliminary treatment of CCM with 0.1-10 mM NaOCl decreased subsequent activation of Lum-CL and Luc-CL of neutrophils depending on the used NaOCl concentration, presumably because of the surface mucin oxidation. Based on the results of ELISA, incubation of neutrophils with CCM downregulated IL-6 production but upregulated that of IL-8. IL-6 and IL-8 gene expression in neutrophils was not affected by CC or CCM according to RT(2)-PCR data, which means that post-translational regulation was involved. Light microscopy revealed adhesion of CC and CCM microparticles onto the neutrophils; CCM increased neutrophil aggregation with a tendency to form neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). We came to the conclusion that the main features of neutrophil reaction to mucin-vaterite hybrid microparticles are increased oxidant production, cell aggregation, and NET-like structure formation, but without significant cytokine release (except for IL-8). This effect of mucin is not anion-specific since particles of powdered kidney stone (mainly calcium oxalate) in the present study or calcium phosphate nanowires in our previous report also activated Lum-CL and Luc-CL response of neutrophils after mucin sorption.

AB  - Urinary stones composed of calcium carbonate are extremely rare, accounting for 0.01%-1.4% of urolithiasis (UL) cases. Urolithiasis is an infrequent condition in the pediatric population worldwide and in Mexico; nevertheless, the incidence in the Yucatan Peninsula is higher than that reported in other areas of Mexico and the world. Urolithiasis is the second most common urinary disease among pediatrics in the Yucatan Peninsula, which makes it an endemic region for this disease. We describe the case of a five-year-old male from the southeast region of Mexico who presented with signs and symptoms of urinary tract infection (UTI) and was diagnosed with bilateral staghorn stones of calcium carbonate, successfully treated by mini endoscopic combined intra-renal surgery, and dietary adjustments to prevent recurrence.

AB  - This report describes cardiovascular and renal soft tissue mineralization and renal intratubular crystals in 13 out of 16 guinea pigs that were given very hard drinking water for 9 months. These animals, aged 14 to 20 months, were experimentally naive. No clinical symptoms were observed, but 1 guinea pig was found dead in its cage. Necropsy did not reveal any gross findings; however, histologic examination revealed mineralization and crystal formations. Despite no known changes in the feed sourcing or formulation, the possibility that the incident was feed-related was considered. The most recent analysis of the feed obtained from the manufacturer during this period, which was conducted by an accredited laboratory authorized by the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, was appropriate. No similar lesions were reported at other centers using the same feed; however, drinking water analysis for total dissolved solids revealed extremely hard water, with elevated levels of calcium and calcium carbonate and low magnesium levels, due to a malfunctioning water treatment system. After installing a new system to balance calcium and magnesium, no new cases appeared over the next 2 years. It was determined that the mineralization and crystal formations were most likely caused by water hardness. This study demonstrates that mineralization typically attributed to feed in guinea pigs can also result from high calcium content in drinking water, highlighting the importance of water analysis in such cases.

AB  - A case of acute renal failure apparently caused by ingestion of large amounts of a magnesium-containing antacid is reported. A 51-year-old man was hospitalized with complete anuria and an associated hyperkalemia and hypermagnesemia. He had been taking 25-30 magnesium trisilicate-aluminum hydroxide (Gelusil) tablets daily for several years to relieve symptoms of gastritis. A renal sonogram and a retrograde pyelogram demonstrated the presence of multiple renal stones that were found to be composed of magnesium-ammonium-phosphate crystals. The patients required surgical removal of the stones and placement of ureteral catheters before renal function improved. An intravenous pyelogram performed four weeks after discharge revealed no apparent residual damage. The etiology, incidence, and characteristics of magnesium-ammonium-phosphate stones are discussed. Previous reports of renal stones associated with magnesium-containing antacids are reviewed.

AB  - Human saliva, pancreatic juice and urine are usually supersaturated with respect to calcium phosphate, calcium carbonate and calcium oxalate, respectively. The potential precipitation of these salts is prevented by unusual phosphoproteins which are normally present in these biological fluids. In vitro, such phosphoproteins are able to suppress the crystal growth of calcium salts; their physiological level is high enough to fulfill this function in vivo. The main molecular characteristics of these phosphoproteins are described and their biological function, as crystallization inhibitors, are discussed by the authors.

AB  - Artifacts such as surgical clips, gallstones, and kidney stones are often present in the soft tissue stripe lateral to vertebral bodies. Using cadaveric specimens, we placed bra wires, gallbladder clips, a large gallstone, a calcium carbonate or a calcium citrate pill lateral to L1, or a large or small calcium-containing kidney stone lateral to L3 and compared the mean bone mineral density (BMD) of individual vertebral bodies and L1-L4 with and without the soft tissue artifact. The specimens used had high BMD (L1-L4 BMD=1.049 g/cm2) and low BMD (L1-L4 BMD=0.669 g/cm2) and were scanned with a Hologic Discovery W scanner with 12.7 software in the array mode. None of the artifacts affected L1 or L3 BMD or L1-L4 BMD significantly in the high BMD spine. However, bra wires, a large calcium citrate pill lateral to L1, 3 calcium citrate pills lateral to L1, a calcium carbonate pill over L1, and 3 calcium carbonate pills lateral to L1 did affect L1-L4 BMD in low BMD torso. Gallbladder clips or gallstone did not affect L1-L4 BMD in either specimen. We conclude that artifacts lateral to the spine, particularly in a low BMD spine, can affect the interpretation of L1-L4 BMD using a Hologic Discovery W scanner with 12.7 software in array mode.

AB  - In hypoparathyroidism (HypoPT), calcium supplementation is virtually always required, although the disease is likely to be associated with an increased risk of nephrolithiasis. The use of calcium citrate (Ca-Cit) theoretically could have a positive impact on the nephrolithiasis risk because citrate salts are used to reduce this risk. Our objective was to evaluate the potential therapeutic advantage of Ca-Cit in comparison with calcium carbonate (CaCO(3) ) in HypoPT, on nephrolithiasis risk factors, as well as to their ability to maintain desirable serum calcium levels. We also evaluated these preparations on quality of life (QOL). This randomized, double-blind, crossover trial recruited 24 adults with postsurgical chronic hypoparathyroidism at Campus Bio-Medico University of Rome. Participants were randomized 1:1 to Ca-Cit or CaCO(3) for 1 month and then crossed over to the other treatment for another month. The primary outcomes were changes in albumin-adjusted serum calcium and in ion activity product of calcium oxalate levels (AP[CaOx] index). Secondary efficacy outcomes included changes in SF-36 survey score, fatigue score, constipation, and adverse events. No difference in terms of AP(CaOx) index was observed between the two groups. However, Ca-Cit was associated with a significant reduction in the oxalate/creatinine ratio compared with CaCO(3) (-2.46 mmol/mol [SD 11.93] versus 7.42 mmol/mol [SD 17.63], p = 0.029). Serum calcium and phosphorus concentration was not different between the two calcium preparations. Ca-Cit was associated with less constipation (p = 0.047). No difference was found in QOL scores. Although Ca-Cit did not modify the AP(CaOx) index when compared with CaCO(3,) it was associated with a reduction in urinary oxalate excretion that could have a potential beneficial effect on nephrolithiasis risk. These results are likely to have clinical implications in HypoPT, particularly those who do not tolerate CaCO(3) and those affected by nephrolithiasis. A longer-term experience is needed to confirm these findings. (c) 2022 The Authors.

AB  - PURPOSE: We measured the concentration and solubility of cystine in urine from patients with cystinuria or calcium stones and from normal subjects to determine whether urine cystine supersaturation can be calculated from a standard nomogram of solubility versus pH or needs to be measured directly. We also evaluated whether increasing pH of the 24-hour collection recovered enough crystallized cystine to increase cystine supersaturation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cystine concentration, pH and usual stone risk factors were measured on 50 ml. aliquots of 24-hour collections from 24 patients with cystinuria, 22 calcium stone formers and 15 normal subjects. After 48 hours of incubation with sodium bicarbonate, a second aliquot was taken from the 24-hour collection for cystine concentration. The original urine at its ambient pH was incubated with an excess of cystine crystals for 24, 48, 72 or 96 hours at 37C to determine solubility and kinetics of equilibration. RESULTS: Cystine solubility varied so widely at any pH range that no predictive nomogram could be relied on for calculating supersaturation. Addition of sodium bicarbonate to the 24-hour urine significantly increased cystine concentration. Urine from stone formers had higher cystine solubility than urine from normal subjects. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical management of cystinuria can be improved by direct measurement of cystine solubility because it varies widely at any given pH. Increasing 24-hour collection pH with sodium bicarbonate additionally improves accuracy of supersaturation measurement by recovering crystallized cystine.

AB  - Mountain tapirs (Tapirus pinchaque) are endangered land mammals and there are few descriptions of urinary diseases that affect them. This report describes a 17-year-old mountain tapir presenting with hyporexia and chronic weight loss caused by unilateral nephrolithiasis and hydronephrosis. Unilateral nephrectomy returned this mountain tapir to normal weight with resolution of clinical signs. Characteristics of the smooth circular uroliths found in this mountain tapir were consistent with the rarer type II variant found in horses and was composed of 100% calcium carbonate. Type II uroliths in horses typically have amorphous shapes and include phosphate. This case showed that mountain tapirs are susceptible to nephrolithiasis, which may progress to hydronephrosis, and that unilateral nephrectomy is a feasible treatment. Despite the success of nephrectomy in this case, further investigation is required in captive mountain tapirs to more clearly understand management of nephrolithiasis and how it equates with what is known in horses.

AB  - Urinary calculi from 17 horses with urolithiasis were examined to study their mineral content and ultrastructure. Among the analytic methods used were X-ray diffractometry, scanning electron microscopy, and electron microprobe analysis. The calculi initially were observed by use of a stereoscopic dissecting microscope and generally were found to have nodular surfaces surrounding a banded or granular-to-chalky interior. Observation by scanning electron microscopy revealed an intricate pattern of irregularly concentric, fine bands and spherules. These had a round, finely banded, globular texture formed by precipitation of ultrafine-grained radiating crystals. The original pore spaces (ie, between spherules, between bands and spherules, or between crystal generations) could be observed as primary porosity. Precipitation and dissolution of these urinary calculi were observed to be spontaneous processes, which can occur simultaneously within an individual calculus. Another prominent feature of the ultrastructure was secondary porosity (spontaneous dissolution) which, in its incipient stages, appeared to be site-selective (ie, some bands appeared to be more susceptible to development of pinpoint porosity). Textures indicative of dissolution were observed not only on the calculus surface, but within the calculus interior as well. Areas that had more advanced stages of dissolution, resulting in increased secondary porosity, also were observed. All 17 samples of the study were found to be composed of calcium carbonate in the form of the mineral calcite, although minor quantities of 2 other polymorphs of calcium carbonate, minerals vaterite and aragonite, also were encountered. Vaterite was observed in 5 of the samples, whereas aragonite was found in 1 sample. Strontium and sulfur were observed as trace elements in 3 of the calculi, whereas magnesium was present in all calculi. Magnesium was observed to substitute for calcium within the calcite crystal lattice in larger quantities than those of strontium or sulfur. Magnesium K alpha X-ray dot maps generated by use of an electron microprobe analyzer indicated that the distribution pattern of magnesium appeared to closely follow layer-by-layer growth of the calculus. Magnesium distribution also appeared to be related to porosity development. In samples where preferential dissolution was observed, the more porous areas had higher magnesium content. Quantitative chemical analyses, using the electron microprobe analyzer, confirmed these observations. Association of the magnesium distribution pattern to the primary growth texture of the calculus indicated that magnesium content of the calculus varied during the formation process. This also indicated that changes in urine chemical analytes may be reflected in composition of the calculi formed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)

AB  - A 66-year-old female visited our university hospital with the chief complaint of right lower abdominal pain in July, 1984. Kidney-ureter-bladder roentgenograms disclosed the right ureter stone and several left renal stones. She passed the right ureter stone composed of calcium oxalate. Thereafter, she passed small stones twice and sand stones twice until September, 1985. The stone analysis revealed two of them as silica. Although most patients with silica stones reported in Japan had a history of long-term medication of magnesium trisilicate, this patient had not taken this drug. Silica stones are rare and fifteen cases including the present case have been reported in Japan.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To identify demographic or signalment factors associated with calcium carbonate urolith formation in goats. DESIGN: Retrospective case series and case-control study. ANIMALS: 354 goats with calcium carbonate uroliths (case animals) and 16,366 goats without urinary tract disease (control animals). PROCEDURES: Medical records of the Minnesota Urolith Center were reviewed to identify case goats for which samples were submitted between January 1, 1984, and December 31, 2012. Control goats evaluated at US veterinary teaching hospitals in the same time period were identified by searching Veterinary Medical Database records. Age, breed, sex, reproductive status, geographic location, season, and anatomic location of collected uroliths were analyzed to identify risk or protective factors associated with calcium carbonate urolithiasis. RESULTS: Nigerian dwarf goats had higher odds of developing calcium carbonate uroliths than did Pygmy goats (reference group). Several breeds had lower odds of this finding, compared with Pygmy goats; odds were lowest for mixed, Anglo-Nubian, and Toggenburg breeds. Breeds of African origin (Pygmy, Nigerian Dwarf, and Boer) comprised 146 of 275 (53%) case goats with data available. Goats of African descent had a higher risk of developing calcium carbonate uroliths than did goats of non-African descent (reference group). Males and neutered goats had higher odds of calcium carbonate urolithiasis, compared with females and sexually intact goats, respectively. Age category, geographic location, and season were associated with detection of calcium carbonate uroliths. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Goats with calcium carbonate uroliths were typically neutered males, > 1 year of age, and of African descent. This study identified factors associated with calcium carbonate urolithiasis in goats; however, these associations do not allow conclusions regarding cause-and-effect relationships.

AB  - Intestinal resection (IR) may lead to hyperoxaluria and nephrolithiasis. A rat model of IR was developed, in which kidney stones form. We describe the urine chemistries and histopathologic features. Rats underwent resection of 40-45 cm of distal ileum (n=16) or sham resection (SR) (n=8), and were then fed a 1% Na oxalate, 0.02% Ca diet. After 1 week on the diet, 24 h urine samples were obtained for stone chemistries. At 4-7 months after surgery, kidneys were examined grossly and by light microscopy. The extent and location of crystallization was assessed by polarized light. Histochemistry and infrared spectroscopy were used to determine crystal composition. IR rats had higher urine oxalate excretion (P<0.01) and concentration (P<0.001) than SR rats, and lower urine citrate excretion; only IR rats formed kidney stones (12/15 surviving rats). Tissue calcification was found only in kidneys from IR rats, located in the cortex (83% of kidneys), medulla (73%) and papillary tip (47%). Crystals, composed of CaOx, apatite, and calcium carbonate, filled collecting duct lumens, and were associated with tubular obstruction, and interstitial inflammation. Crystals in the papillary interstitium incited inflammation with tubular destruction and development of progressive papillary erosion. This new rat model of nephrolithiasis and nephrocalcinosis resembles the pattern of urinary abnormalities and tissue calcification that may be seen in humans with small bowel resection. The model allows further studies of the mechanisms of renal crystal formation, and possible therapeutic interventions.

AB  - Sodium pyruvate, potassium pyruvate, pyruvic acid, sodium bicarbonate and potassium bicarbonate were added to a calcium-oxalate lithogenic diet (a glycolic-acid diet) in order to determine their effects in preventing lithogenicity. Male Wistar-strain rats who had been fed the glycolic-acid diet developed marked urinary calculi within four weeks. Rats in the sodium and potassium pyruvate groups had, however, almost no stones in the urinary system. Rats in the bicarbonate and pyruvic-acid groups showed slightly less effect than those in the pyruvate groups. Urinary oxalate excretion was high in all the groups during the experiment. The urinary oxalate concentration was relatively higher in the sodium-pyruvate group, and significantly higher in the potassium-pyruvate group, than in the glycolic-acid group. Urinary citrate excretion was high both in the pyruvate and bicarbonate groups; the urinary citrate concentration was, however, significantly higher in the pyruvate groups than in the bicarbonate groups at the fourth experimental week. The urinary calcium and magnesium concentrations were irrelevant to the diets administered. Therefore, it can be concluded that pyruvate salts inhibit urinary calculi formation, not by decreasing oxalate synthesis, but by increasing the urinary citrate concentration; bicarbonate salts work in the same manner, but a little less effectively.

AB  - Magnesium oxide, magnesium hydroxide, magnesium sulfate, magnesium trisilicate, and magnesium citrate were added to a calcium-oxalate lithogenic diet in order to determine their effects in preventing lithogenesis. Male Wistar-strain rats which had been fed the glycolic-acid diet developed marked urinary calculi within four weeks. Rats in the magnesium-hydroxide, magnesium-citrate, and magnesium-trisilicate groups, however, had almost no stones in the urinary system. Rats in the magnesium-oxide and magnesium-sulfate groups showed significantly less effect than those in the former three groups. During the experimental period, the 24-hour urinary oxalate excretion and concentration were higher in the glycolic-acid group than in the other groups. The urinary citrate excretion and concentration were the highest in the magnesium-hydroxide and magnesium-citrate groups and higher in the magnesium-trisilicate and magnesium-oxide groups than in the magnesium-sulfate and glycolic-acid groups. Similar trends were observed in the urinary magnesium excretion and in its concentration. The urinary calcium excretion and concentration were higher in the experimental groups than in the glycolic-acid group. The urinary calcium/magnesium ratio remained mostly unchanged. Therefore, it can be concluded that alkaline magnesium salts increase the urinary calcium and magnesium concentrations, without changing the calcium/magnesium ratio, and inhibit urinary calculi formation, most likely by increasing the urinary citrate concentration.

AB  - The effects of calcium supplementation on urinary oxalate excretion was tested in 9 normal subjects, 4 males and 5 females between 23 and 49 years of age. In a crossover study 800 mg calcium was orally administered as active absorbable algal calcium (AAACa) (A) and calcium carbonate (B), and compared with non-calcium containing placebo (C). Calcium, oxalate, osmolality, creatinine and pH were measured in the first three morning urine samples and Ca/osmolality, Ca/osmolality/body weight, Ca/creatinine and oxalate/osmolality were calculated to correct for urine dilution. Ca x oxalate product was also calculated and Ca oxalate crystal in the sediment was microscopically examined and semiquantitatively estimated as -, +, ++, and +++ expressed as 0, 1, 2 and 3 respectively. Urinary Ca excretion was similar in A and B, but significantly larger than C, regardless of the method of correction for dilution. Urinary oxalate excretion tended to be lower in A than in B and C. Urine pH was similar among all three groups. Ca x oxalate product was higher in C than in A and B. AAACa, unlike calcium carbonate, appeared to decrease urinary oxalate excretion and Ca x oxalate product more efficiently than Ca carbonate, suggesting a possibility of inhibiting the formation of Ca x oxalate kidney stones. Formation of calcium oxalate was also tested in vitro by adding oxalate to urine samples and aqueous calcium solution.

AB  - In nine normal subjects, four men and five women between 23 and 49 years of age, 800mg calcium was orally administered as active absorbable algal calcium (AAA Ca) (A) and calcium carbonate (CaCO3) (B), to compare with non-calcium-containing placebo (C) in a crossover design. Calcium, oxalate, osmolality, creatinine, and pH were measured in the first three morning urine samples and Ca/osmolality, Ca/osmolality/body weight, Ca/creatinine, and oxalate/ osmolality were calculated to correct for urine dilution. Ca x oxalate product was also calculated, and Ca oxalate crystal in the sediment was microscopically examined, semiquantitatively estimated as -, +, ++, or , and numerically expressed as 0, 1, 2, or 3, respectively. Urinary Ca excretion was similar in groups A and B, but significantly larger than in group C, regardless of the method of correction for dilution. Urinary oxalate excretion with correction for osmolality, however, was significantly lower in A than in B and C, which gave similar values. Urine pH was similar among all three groups. Ca x oxalate product was significantly higher in C than in A, but A and B were not significantly different. AAA Ca appeared to decrease urinary oxalate excretion and Ca x oxalate product more efficiently than CaCO3, suggesting the possibility of inhibiting the formation of Ca x oxalate kidney stones.

AB  - HISTORY AND CLINICAL FINDINGS: A 54-year-old man was hospitalised because hypercalcaemia and associated renal failure were suspected. He had a history suggesting gastric ulcer, with nonspecific back and shoulder pain and spontaneously passed kidney stone. On admission the patient reported reduction in physical fitness, fatigue, headache and nausea without vomiting. Physical examination was unremarkable except for pain on pressure over the thoracic and lumbar vertebrae. INVESTIGATIONS: Hypercalcaemia of 3.9 mmol/l was found while parathormone was low. Serum creatinine concentration was 2.8 mg/dl. Malignancy was excluded after extensive tests. A florid gastric ulcer was demonstrated, together with Helicobacter pylori infection. Computed tomography revealed stippled calcifications in the kidneys. TREATMENT AND COURSE: Renal function markedly improved, the hypercalcaemia disappeared and the parathormone level rose within four days of the administration of sodium chloride (2.51 daily of a 0.9% solution) and of furosemide (40 mg daily). Repeat questioning of the patient revealed that because of stomach pains he had for four years been taking up to 6 g calcium carbonate daily in the form of a prescription-free antacid. He was thereupon treated for a milk-alkali syndrome. Calcium concentration became normal, while renal function has remained slightly impaired a year later. The ulcer has healed without recurrence on eradication of the Helicobacter pylori infection with amoxicillin and omeprazole. CONCLUSIONS: The danger of some "over the counter" prescription-free medications should not be underestimated and patients should be routinely questioned about them. Absorbable antacids should no longer be taken in the treatment of peptic complaints now that effective antacids, H2-receptor antagonists and proton-pump inhibitors have become available.

AB  - Citrate is used commonly as an alkalinizing agent and in the management of nephrolithiasis, but its quantitative effect on acid-base homeostasis, as judged by changes in renal net acid excretion, has not been delineated. We therefore administered 61 mEq of sodium citrate/day for 4 days to 10 normal volunteers and compared the results to those obtained in 10 normal subjects (4 of whom also participated in the citrate protocol) given 60 mEq/day for 4 days of sodium bicarbonate, the prototypical alkalinizing agent. We found that the sodium citrate group experienced an average reduction in net acid excretion (45.5 +/- 7.2 mEq/day) that was very similar to that (42.0 +/- 7.2 mEq/day) induced by the same amount of sodium bicarbonate. In both groups, the reduction in net acid excretion was equivalent to approximately 70% of the alkali administered. The latter appeared to relate to an average negative hydrogen ion balance of approximately 15 mEq/day, since there was an increase in blood [HCO3] in each group of about 2.5 mEq/l. We conclude that the findings demonstrate that the short-term effects of sodium citrate on acid-base homeostasis in normal subjects are indistinguishable from those of sodium bicarbonate.

AB  - Renal disease is commonly encountered by primary care physicians during their day-to-day visits with patients. Common renal disorders include hypertension, proteinuria, kidney stones, and chronic kidney disease. Despite their prevalence, many physicians may be unfamiliar with the diagnosis and initial treatment of these common renal disorders. Early recognition and intervention are important in slowing the progression of chronic kidney disease and preventing its complications. The evidence-based pearls in this article will help primary care physicians avoid common pitfalls in the recognition and treatment of such disorders and guide their decision to refer their patients to a specialist.

AB  - Adequate daily calcium intake should normally be achieved by dietary sources. Since low calcium diets are quite common in subjects that do not reach the recommended intake and particularly those at risk of fractures, calcium supplements may become necessary. Different forms of calcium salts are available, but products containing calcium citrate and calcium carbonate complexes are the most frequently used. Although only limited evidence on the efficacy and long-term safety of calcium citrate is available, these supplements may represent a valuable product for the management of different chronic pathological conditions. The aim of this review was to evaluate the current and potential clinical applications of calcium citrate. In particular, we focused on the use of calcium citrate supplementation in subjects with osteoporosis or in bariatric patients. Other pathological conditions that could benefit calcium citrate supplementation may include achloridria, chronic hypoparathyroidism and hypocitraturic subjects with moderate/high risk of nephrolithiasis. Indeed, citrate salts are widely used in the treatment of nephrolithiasis, since they have shown an inhibitory effect on kidney stone formation and recurrence.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: We hypothesized that adding sodium bicarbonate (bicarb) to normal saline (NS) irrigation during ureteroscopy in patients with uric acid (UA) nephrolithiasis may assist in dissolving small stone fragments produced during laser lithotripsy. In vitro testing was performed to determine whether dissolution of UA fragments could be accomplished within 1 hour. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In total 100% UA renal calculi were fragmented, filtered, and separated by size. Fragment sizes were <0.5 mm and 0.5 to 1 mm. Similar amounts of stone material were agitated in solution at room temperature. Four solutions were tested (NS, NS +1 ampule bicarb/L, NS +2, NS +3). Both groups were filtered to remove solutions after fixed periods. Filtered specimens were dried and weighed. Fragment dissolution rates were calculated as percent removed per hour. Additional testing was performed to determine whether increasing the temperature of solution affected dissolution rates. RESULTS: For fragments <0.5 mm, adding 2 or 3 bicarb ampules/L NS produced a dissolution rate averaging 91% +/- 29% per hour. This rate averaged 226% faster than NS alone. With fragments 0.5 to 1 mm, addition of 2 or 3 bicarb ampules/L NS yielded a dissolution rate averaging 22% +/- 7% per hour, which was nearly five times higher than NS alone. There was a trend for an increase in mean dissolution rate with higher temperature but this increase was not significant (p = 0.30). CONCLUSIONS: The addition of bicarbonate to NS more than doubles the dissolution rate of UA stone fragments and fragments less than 0.5 mm can be completely dissolved within 1 hour. Addition of bicarb to NS irrigation is a simple and inexpensive approach that may assist in the dissolution of UA fragments produced during ureteroscopic laser lithotripsy. Further studies are needed to determine whether a clinical benefit exists.

AB  - CASE DESCRIPTION A 5-year-old sexually intact female guinea pig was evaluated because of mild dysuria and a subcutaneous mass located cranioventral to the urogenital openings. CLINICAL FINDINGS Non-contrast-enhanced CT and surgical exploration of the distal aspect of the urethra revealed a urethral diverticulum with an intraluminal urolith. Analysis revealed that the urolith was composed of calcium carbonate and struvite. TREATMENT AND OUTCOME The urolith was surgically removed and ablation of the urethral diverticulum was attempted. Approximately 3 months later, the guinea pig was reevaluated for masses in the perineal region, and positive-contrast urethrocystography revealed 2 uroliths present in the same diverticulum. Uroliths were manually expressed with the patient under general anesthesia. Approximately 2 weeks later, urethroplasty was performed to create an enlarged stoma with the diverticulum, thereby preventing urine from pooling in the diverticulum and potentially reducing the risk of future urolith formation. The urethroplasty site healed well with no reported complications or evidence of urolith recurrence 6 months after surgery. CLINICAL RELEVANCE Urolithiasis is common in guinea pigs, and urethral diverticulum and intraluminal urolith formation should be considered as a potential differential diagnosis for a subcutaneous mass along the distal aspect of the urethra. Creation of a urethral stoma from a urethral diverticulum via urethroplasty achieved a successful outcome in this patient.

AB  - In a 4x4-wk cross-over study, eight adult cats were given four moist diets containing identical amounts of calcium (13.9 mmol/MJ) but with different ratios of calcium carbonate to calcium chloride, the calcium salts providing half of the total dietary calcium. Increasing amounts of calcium chloride were substituted for equimolar amounts of calcium carbonate. Higher intakes of calcium chloride caused significantly lower pH values in postprandial and 24-h urine samples. The urinary excretion of ammonium and titratable acid rose with increasing calcium chloride intake. The urinary concentrations of calcium and magnesium were not affected by the type of calcium salt, but the urinary excretion and concentration of phosphorus were significantly depressed when the amount of calcium chloride in the diet was increased. The results are discussed in the context of dietary prevention of and therapy for struvite urolithiasis in cats.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The dissolution of urinary stones could be performed in the patients with urinary obstruction caused by phosphate, or uric acid stones, through the percutaneous nephrostomy (PCN). CASE REPORT: A 27-year-old woman with complete obstruction of the solitary left kidney due to uric acid stones is presented. The woman was admitted in emergency unit due to anuria. Five days after PCN, irrigation with 1.6% sodium bicarbonate solution was initiated. Due to complete ureteral obstruction, the "Y" extension with the valve was connected to PCN and to the urinary bag, which enabled the patient to perform intermittent self-irrigation. After 12 days of irrigation, all the stones dissolute and ceased. CONCLUSION: In the era of ESWL, PCNL and ureterorenoscopy, PCN-dissolution of urinary stones is rare procedure. However, this minimally invasive procedure could be successfully performed in selected cases.

AB  - Certain types of pyeloureteral calculi can be treated by chemolytic drug irrigation through a percutaneous nephrostomy catheter. Struvite, apatite, and carbonate stones can be dissolved with an acidic solution (hemiacidrin, Suby solution G). An alkaline agent (Tham-E, acetylcysteine) will dissolve cystine calculi. While most uric acid stones are managed by oral alkalinization with sodium bicarbonate or potassium citrate, there are occasions (cardiac, metabolic conditions) where treatment via percutaneous nephrostomy is preferable. Successful nonoperative management of symptomatic calculi has been obtained in 85% of cases with chemolysis of more than 150 stones.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of oral sodium bicarbonate (NaBic) supplementation upon urinary citrate excretion in calcium stone formers (CSFs). METHODS: Sixteen adult calcium stone formers with hypocitraturia were enrolled in a randomized, double-blind, crossover protocol using 60 mEq/day of NaBic during 3 days compared to the same period and doses of potassium citrate (KCit) supplementation. Blood and 24-hour urine samples were collected at baseline and during the third day of each alkali salt. RESULTS: NaBic, similarly to KCit supplementation, led to an equivalent and significant increase in urinary citrate and pH. Compared to baseline, NaBic led to a significant increase in sodium excretion without concomitant increases in urinary calcium excretion, whereas KCit induced a significant increase in potassium excretion coupled with a significant reduction in urinary calcium. Although NaBic and KCit both reduced calcium oxalate supersaturation (CaOxSS) significantly vs baseline, KCit reduced calcium oxalate supersaturation significantly further vs NaBic. Both KCit and NaBic significantly reduced urinary phosphate and increased calcium phosphate supersaturation (CaPSS) compared to baseline. Finally, a significantly higher sodium urate supersaturation (NaUrSS) was observed after the use of the 2 drugs. CONCLUSION: This short-term study suggests that NaBic represents an effective alternative for the treatment of hypocitraturic calcium oxalate stone formers who cannot tolerate or afford the cost of KCit. In view of the increased sodium urate supersaturation, patients with pure uric acid stones and high urate excretion may be less suited for treatment with NaBic.

AB  - Familial Hypomagnesemia, Hypercalciuria with Nephrocalcinosis is a rare autosomal recessive inherited disease associated with renal failure. Two girls born of consanguineous parentage aged 16 and 17 presented to us with renal failure, nephrocalcinosis and bone deformities. On evaluation they were found to have hypomagnesemia, hypercalciuria, increased fractional excretion of magnesium, hypocitraturia, renal failure and elevated PTH. Their parental screening was normal. There were no extra-renal features in them. One sibling had nephrolithiasis and the stone analysis revealed calcium phosphate stones. Both were treated with sodium bicarbonate, thiazides, calcitriol and calcium carbonate. They did not require dialysis during hospital stay. Both of them were treated conservatively. They are on regular outpatient follow up. The primary defect in this syndrome is impaired paracellular reabsorption of magnesium and calcium in the medullary thick ascending limb. Mutations in the PCLN-1gene which encodes for the tight junction protein paracellin -1 is identified as the underlying genetic defect. Ocular abnormalities and deafness are the commonly reported associations. End stage renal failure usually occurs in second to third decade. Renal transplantation is the definite treatment.

AB  - SUMMARY: The Women's Health Initiative (WHI) double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial randomly assigned 36,282 postmenopausal women in the U.S. to 1,000 mg elemental calcium carbonate plus 400 IU of vitamin D(3) daily or placebo, with average intervention period of 7.0 years. The trial was designed to test whether calcium plus vitamin D supplementation in a population in which the use of these supplements was widespread would reduce hip fracture, and secondarily, total fracture and colorectal cancer. INTRODUCTION: This study further examines the health benefits and risks of calcium and vitamin D supplementation using WHI data, with emphasis on fractures, cardiovascular disease, cancer, and total mortality. METHODS: WHI calcium and vitamin D randomized clinical trial (CT) data through the end of the intervention period were further analyzed with emphasis on treatment effects in relation to duration of supplementation, and these data were contrasted and combined with corresponding data from the WHI prospective observational study (OS). RESULTS: Among women not taking personal calcium or vitamin D supplements at baseline, the hazard ratio [HR] for hip fracture occurrence in the CT following 5 or more years of calcium and vitamin D supplementation versus placebo was 0.62 (95 % confidence interval (CI), 0.38-1.00). In combined analyses of CT and OS data, the corresponding HR was 0.65 (95 % CI, 0.44-0.98). Supplementation effects were not apparent on the risks of myocardial infarction, coronary heart disease, total heart disease, stroke, overall cardiovascular disease, colorectal cancer, or total mortality, while evidence for a reduction in breast cancer risk and total invasive cancer risk among calcium plus vitamin D users was only suggestive. CONCLUSION: Though based primarily on a subset analysis, long-term use of calcium and vitamin D appears to confer a reduction that may be substantial in the risk of hip fracture among postmenopausal women. Other health benefits and risks of supplementation at doses considered, including an elevation in urinary tract stone formation, appear to be modest and approximately balanced.

AB  - Therapeutically, magnesium salts represent an important class of compounds and exhibit various pharmacologic actions. Examples of magnesium salts are ionic magnesium and magnesium citrate in nephrolithiasis, magnesium salicylate in rheumatoid arthritis, magnesium hydroxide as an antacid as well as a cathartic, and magnesium mandelate as urinary antiseptic. Various anions attached to the cation magnesium, such as oxide, chloride, gluconate, and lactate, affect the delivery of the amounts of elemental magnesium to the target site and thereby produce different pharmacodynamic effects. This review examines the bioavailability and pharmacokinetics of various magnesium salts and correlates pharmacodynamic action with the structure-activity relationship.

AB  - The aim of this study was to determine whether extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) affected the viability of the infecting bacteria within a simulated struvite stone matrix. A strain, Proteus mirabilis 28cii, was prepared in three forms: (1) suspended in saline and urine, (2) artificially encapsulated by suspending in agar beads and (3) artificially encapsulated and mineralised by suspending in agar beads with calcium carbonate crystals. The preparations were placed in capped vials partially immersed in degassed water and held in the focal point of the Siemens Lithostar and given 1,000 shocks. Subsequent viability testing showed that bacteria suspended in urine were greatly affected by shock treatments (55% loss in viability), but incorporation into agar beads negated this effect (even if the cells were exposed to 2000 shocks). Mineralisation of the beads with calcium carbonate crystals caused a decrease in viability of 82% that was significantly different from controls. However, this still left 2.3 X 10(8) viable organisms (82% of 2.8 X 10(8], easily enough to form the focus for further infections. A series of control experiments carried out using an ultrasonic cell sonicator probe gave comparable results to those obtained with ESWL. These results demonstrate the ESWL treatment of infected stones must be accompanied by antimicrobial coverage.

AB  - There has been considerable investigation into the health benefits of calcium citrate malate (CCM) since it was first patented in the late 1980s. This chapter is a comprehensive summary of the supporting science and available evidence on the bioavailability and health benefits of consuming CCM. It highlights the important roles that CCM can play during various life stages. CCM has been shown to facilitate calcium retention and bone accrual in children and adolescents. In adults, it effectively promotes the consolidation and maintenance of bone mass. In conjunction with vitamin D, CCM also decreases bone fracture risk in the elderly, slows the rate of bone loss in old age, and is of benefit to the health and well-being of postmenopausal women. CCM is exceptional in that it confers many unique benefits that go beyond bone health. Unlike other calcium sources that necessitate supplementation be in conjunction with a meal to ensure an appreciable benefit is derived, CCM can be consumed with or without food and delivers a significant nutritional benefit to individuals of all ages. The chemistry of CCM makes it a particularly beneficial calcium source for individuals with hypochlorydia or achlorydia, which generally includes the elderly and those on medications that decrease gastric acid secretion. CCM is also recognized as a calcium source that does not increase the risk of kidney stones, and in fact it protects against stone-forming potential. The versatile nature of CCM makes it a convenient and practical calcium salt for use in moist foods and beverages. The major factor that may preclude selection of CCM as a preferred calcium source is the higher cost compared to other sources of calcium commonly used for fortification (e.g., calcium carbonate and tricalcium phosphate). However, formation of CCM directly within beverages or other fluid foods and/or preparations, and the addition of a concentrated CCM solution or slurry, are relatively cost-effective methods by which CCM can be incorporated into finished food and beverage products.

AB  - The actual preventive and therapeutic effects of alkalinizing urine on melamine-induced bladder stones (cystolith) are not completely known. Using an ideal model, two experiments were conducted in Balb/c mice. The mice were fed a normal diet in controls and a melamine diet in the other groups. The first day was set as experiment-day 1. In "Experiment 1", either low-/mid-/high-dose sodium bicarbonate (SB) or sterile water was administered by intragastric perfusion (once daily) to the mice for 14 days. Relative to the model group, the mean pH of the urine in the SB groups was significantly elevated at 3 h after SB administration, with a significant decrease in cystolith incidence on experiment-day 14. In "Experiment 2", on experiment-day 12, the melamine diet was replaced by a normal diet in 4 groups with melamine withdrawal (MW). Meanwhile, either mid-/high-dose SB or sterile water was administered by intragastric perfusion (once) to the mice in the corresponding groups. On experiment-day 12, after an additional 8 h, the cystolith incidence was significantly reduced in the high-SB, MW + mid-SB and MW + high-SB groups than in the model group. In conclusion, low urinary pH is one of the main determinants of the formation of melamine-associated stones, urinary alkalinization can be achieved by a proper dose of oral SB, and SB acts to prevent and treat melamine-induced cystoliths in mice.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Urinary calcium (Uca) levels in space reflect bone loss and kidney stone risk and could be measured using portable devices. This project evaluated the repeatability of Uca measurements to assess how many repeated measurements would be needed to detect significant urinary calcium elevations in space.METHODS: A total of six subjects collected 24-h urine samples weekly for 8 wk and took 500 mg of oral calcium carbonate and 400 IU of vitamin D daily in week 7 and 8. Uca concentration was analyzed using a calcein-based system. The effect of the intake of calcium and vitamin D on Uca levels and the correlation between first void concentration and 24-h mass were assessed with linear mixed effect models. The reproducibility coefficient (RPC) for Uca was determined using Bland-Altman analysis on pairs of measurements at different time points.RESULTS: Oral supplementation did not significantly affect 24-h mass. First void concentration correlated with 24-h mass. The 24-h mass RPCs were 167.0, 116.8, and 108.1 mg for 1-, 2-, and 3-wk average measurements. First void concentration RPCs were 90.6, 76.6, and 72.8 mg L(1). Skylab astronauts 24-h mass increased by 88.9 76.0, 123.5 58.3, 142.2 56.5, and 159.9 83.4 mg after 1, 2, 3, and 4 wk in flight.DISCUSSION: Averaging multiple Uca measurements reduced variability effectively and allowed increases likely to be seen in space to be detected. Consecutive Uca measurements could be tracked over time in space to assess the effectiveness of the countermeasure program. First void concentration could potentially be used rather than 24-h collections.Ren J, Stankovic AS, Knaus DA, Phillips SD, Kynor DB, Buckey JC.

AB  - All urinary calculi should be thoroughly examined. Among 2 000 calculi analyzed by infra-red spectrophotometry, some were found to contain rare constituants and drugs which might be held responsible for urinary stone formation. These included glafenine, triamterene, co-trimoxazole, sulphaguanidine, allopurinol, phenazopyridine, flumequine and anti-acid powders containing aluminium, calcium and magnesium trisilicates and/or carbonates or bicarbonates. Considering that these drugs are widely used, the incidence of drug-induced urinary calculi appears to be very low.

AB  - BACKGROUND: A 56-year-old white woman was referred to our institution with a 16-month history of severe, gouty, recurrent, acute polyarthritis involving the finger joints. She also had numerous small subcutaneous tophi in her hands. The patient was intolerant to allopurinol and had mild renal insufficiency attributed to uric-acid nephrolithiasis and interstitial nephropathy. INVESTIGATIONS: Physical examination, laboratory testing, X-rays of the hands, feet and pelvis, CT of the pelvis, microscopic analysis of an aspirate from a finger tophus. DIAGNOSIS: Tophaceous gout associated with urate nephropathy in a patient intolerant to allopurinol. MANAGEMENT: Acute polyarthritis was successfully managed by intravenous bolus methylprednisolone combined with codeine, diclofenac and low-dose colchicine. Rasburicase infusions combined with fenofibrate and sodium bicarbonate achieved to maintain serum acid uric below 360 micromol/l.

AB  - A critical examination of data in the literature and in as yet unpublished laboratory records on the possible role of so-called inhibitors of crystallisation in preventing the formation of calcium-containing kidney stones leads to the following conclusions. So-called inhibitors of spontaneous "self-nucleation" are unlikely to play any role in the initiation of the crystallisation of CaOx or CaP in urine because excessive urinary supersaturation of urine with respect to these salts dominates the onset of "self-nucleation" within the normal time frame of the transit of tubular fluid through the nephron (3-4 min). Inhibitors of the crystal growth of CaOx crystals may or may not play a significant role in the prevention of CaOx stone-formation since once again excessive supersaturation of urine can overwhelm any potential effect of the inhibitors on the growth process. However, they may play a role as inhibitors of crystal growth at lower levels of metastable supersaturation when the balance between supersaturation and inhibitors is more equal. Inhibitors of CaOx crystal aggregation may play a significant role in the prevention of stones, since they do not appear to be strongly affected by excessive supersaturation, either in vitro or in vivo. Inhibitors of CaOx crystal binding to renal tubular epithelium may exist but further studies are necessary to elucidate their importance in reducing the risk of initiating stones in the renal tubules. Inhibitors of CaOx crystal binding to Randall's Plaques and Randall's Plugs may exist but further studies are necessary to elucidate their importance in reducing the risk of initiating stones on renal papillae. There may be an alternative explanation other than a deficiency in the excretion of inhibitors for the observations that there is a difference between CaOx crystal size and degree of aggregation in the fresh, warm urines of normal subjects compared those in urine from patients with recurrent CaOx stones. This difference may depend more on the site of "self-nucleation" of CaOx crystals in the renal tubule rather than on a deficiency in the excretion of so-called inhibitors of crystallisation by patients with CaOx stones. The claim that administration of potassium citrate, potassium magnesium citrate or magnesium hydroxide reduces the rate of stone recurrence may be due to the effect of these forms of medication on the supersaturation of urine with respect to CaOx and CaP rather than to any increase in "inhibitory activity" attributed to these forms of treatment. In summary, there is a competition between supersaturation and so-called inhibitors of crystallisation which ultimately determines the pattern of crystalluria in stone-formers and normals. If the supersaturation of urine with respect to CaOx reaches or exceeds the 3-4 min formation product of that salt, then it dominates the crystallisation process both in terms of "self-nucleation" and crystal growth but appears to have little or no effect on the degree of aggregation of the crystals produced. At supersaturation levels of urine with respect to CaOx well below the 3-4 min formation product of that salt, the influence of inhibitors increases and some may affect not only the degree of aggregation but also the crystal growth of any pre-formed crystals of CaOx at these lower levels of metastability.

The powders had been obtained from pharmacists unknown to the patients' medical practitioners. It is suggested that these preparations were responsible for the patient's problems, and that such powders should no longer be freely obtainable.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To report use of transendoscopic electrohydraulic shockwave lithotripsy for fragmentation of urinary calculi in horses. STUDY DESIGN: Case series. ANIMALS: Male horses (n = 21). METHODS: Fragmentation of cystic calculi (median, 6 cm diameter; range, 4-11 cm diameter) was achieved by transurethral endoscopy in standing sedated horses using an electrohydraulic shockwave fiber introduced through the biopsy channel of an endoscope. The fiber was advanced until it contacted the calculus. Repeated activation of the fiber was used to disrupt the calculus into fragments <1 cm diameter. Visibility within the bladder was maintained by repeated lavage with saline solution. RESULTS: Complete calculus removal was achieved in 20 horses (95%) with mean total surgical time of 168.6 minutes (range, 45-450). In the 20 horses with single calculi, 1-6 sessions were required to completely fragment the calculus. Except for 1 horse, in which perineal urethrotomy was eventually performed for complete fragment removal, fragments calculi were excreted via the urethra. Postoperative complications included hematuria because of severe mucosal erosion (n = 2), dysuria because of a trapped urethral fragment (2), small amount of urinary debris (1). One horse was euthanatized because of bladder rupture. Complete clearance of calculi and urinary debris was confirmed endoscopically 20 (3-45) days after the last session. Telephone follow-up (mean, 18.8 months; range, 7-24 months) revealed that horses had returned to previous activity levels without recurrence of clinical signs. CONCLUSIONS: Transendoscopic electrohydraulic lithotripsy appears to be an effective method for fragmentation of low-density calcium carbonate cystic calculi in male horses.

AB  - An in vitro model was devised to evaluate the efficacy of the different irrigating solutions utilized for local dissolution of uric acid stones. Tris (hydroxymethyl) aminomethane proved to be several times faster than sodium bicarbonate in dissolving uric acid calculi. The maximal dissolution rate was obtained when the highest pH (10.5) of Tris buffer was used in concentrations at or above 0.2 M. This makes the commercially available THAM-E an optimal choice. Stones averaging 1 cm. in diameter were dissolved in less than 48 hours when this compound was used. Sodium bicarbonate should only be used in solutions with concentrations lower than 0.2 M and pH below 9, if some dissolution is to be attempted. Concentrations and pH's above these levels will coat the stones with hard shells of sodium urate, making it impossible to dissolve them. The in vitro findings were confirmed in vivo in a limited study in pigs with human uric acid calculi surgically placed in their kidneys. Our results indicate how to make the best use of the solutions clinically available in order to obtain total dissolution of uric acid stones in short periods of time. We recommend the use of a 0.3 molar concentration of this buffer (THAM-E) at flow rates of about 50 cc per hour.

AB  - Objectives of the study were to measure water hardness in Burdur, and to establish its possible association with urolithiasis in cattle. Water samples were obtained from different stables (n = 15). Water hardness and the concentrations of potassium, calcium, magnesium, sodium, iron, zinc, manganese and copper ions were calculated from these water samples. Total hardness of the samples (mean 285 ppm) exceeded the standards and the water was characterized by high content of magnesium ions. Kidneys (n = 500) were collected randomly from slaughterhouses and examined for urolithiasis. Urolithiasis was observed in 102 kidneys (20.4%). The weights of the stones were between 0.02 and 237.44 g and the colour varied from white to brown. The calculi collected had various shapes and composed of calcium apatite (42.45%), struvite (20.15%), magnesium carbonate (15.15%), calcium carbonate (12.12%), and calcium phosphate cystine (10.13%). It was concluded that high water hardness with high magnesium ion concentrations in water may contribute to urolithiasis and needs to be investigated further in future studies.

AB  - BACKGROUND: It has been suggested that citrate salts might enhance aluminum (Al) absorption from a normal diet, posing a threat of Al toxicity even in subjects with normal renal function. We have recently reported that in normal subjects and patients with moderate renal failure, short-term treatment with tricalcium dicitrate (Ca3Cit2) does not significantly change urinary and serum Al levels. However, we have not assessed total body Al stores in patients on long-term citrate treatment. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to ascertain body content of Al non-invasively using the increment in serum and urinary Al following the intravenous administration of deferoxamine (DFO) in patients with kidney stones and osteoporotic women undergoing long-term treatment with potassium citrate (K3Cit) or Ca3Cit2, respectively. METHODS: Ten patients with calcium nephrolithiasis and five with osteoporosis who were maintained on potassium citrate (40 mEq/day or more) or calcium citrate 800 mg calcium/day (40 mEq citrate) for 2 to 8 years, respectively, and 16 normal volunteers without a history of regular aluminum-containing antacid use participated in the study. All participants completed the 8 days of study, during which they were maintained on their regular home diet. Urinary Al excretion was measured during a two-day baseline before (Days 5, 6) and for 1 day (Day 7) immediately following a single intravenous dose of DFO (40 mg/kg). Blood for Al was obtained before DFO administration, and at 2, 5 and 24 hours following the start of the infusion. RESULTS: The median 24-hour urinary Al excretion (microgram/day) at baseline versus post-DFO value was 15.9 vs. 44.4 in the normal subjects and 13.3 vs. 35.7 in the patients. These values were all within normal limits and did not change significantly following DFO infusion (p = 0.003 and p = 0.0001, respectively). The median change of 17.1 micrograms/day in urinary Al in the normal subjects was not significantly different from the 18.7 micrograms/day change measured in the patient group (p = 0.30). Similarly, no change in the mean serum Al was detected at any time following the DFO infusion, either in the patient or control group (patients 4.1 to 4.3 ng/ml, controls 7.4 to 4.6 ng/ml). CONCLUSION: The results suggest that abnormal total body retention of Al does not occur during long-term citrate treatment in patients with functioning kidneys.

AB  - Historically, cystine stone chemolysis has been approached with 2 different categories of compounds--alkalizing agents (sodium bicarbonate and tromethamine) and, more recently, protonated thiols and disulfide compounds (alpha-mercaptopropionylglycine, N-acetylcysteine and penicillamine). To establish the relative efficacy of these agents an in vitro model was devised that simulates the clinical setting. The optimal molar concentrations for sodium bicarbonate, N-acetylcysteine and tromethamine were determined initially and then compared at these strengths. Lastly, a variety of solution combinations were made to determine if a synergistic effect could be demonstrated. Results of this study demonstrate that the combination of acetylcysteine, a protonated thiol, with the strong alkalizing agent sodium hydroxide yields the most effective solution for chemolysis of cystine stones. The mechanism of action is believed to occur by a synergistic combination of the pH dependent increase in cystine solubility, with a simultaneously occurring thiol disulfide interchange.

AB  - Eight patients (6 women and 2 men) with osteoporosis caused or aggravated by renal acidification defects are presented. Three of the female patients were premenopausal; the others were 9, 20 and 22 years postmenopausal, and two of them were on hormonal replacement therapy. Two patients had nephrolithiasis: one male with recurrent calcium phosphate stones and a left sided staghorn calculus, and one female with nephrocalcinosis due to medullary sponge kidney and hypercalciuria (patients No. 1 and 2, respectively, Table 1). In the remaining subjects, clinical suspicion was based on: a) Hip fracture in a 44-yr-old premenopausal female without any risk factor (No. 3, Table 2). b) Several vertebral compression fractures in a 45-yr-old male without hypogonadism or other predisposing factors (No. 7, Table 2). c) Lack of response to antiosteoporotic therapy in 3 women (patients No. 4, 6 and 8, Table 2). Serum bicarbonate levels and urine acidification capacity were studied in all patients. Three had low serum bicarbonate (two of whom showed high fractional excretion of bicarbonate), four had a distal defect, and one had a mixed form. Serum creatinine and potassium, and venous blood pH were normal in all cases, suggesting incomplete renal tubular acidosis. Bone mineral density in Z-score (means +/- s.e.m.) was - 1.75 +/- 0.08 in the lumbar spine (n = 8), and - 1.57 +/- 0.09 in the femoral neck (n = 4) [Tables 1 and 2; Figs 1 and 2]. Following one year treatment with oral sodium bicarbonate and potassium citrate, total skeletal calcium increased by 3-10% in five of the patients. Whereas the high prevalence of renal acidification defects among renal stone formers with or without hypercalciuria is well acknowledged, renal tubular acidosis is not included in the list of entities causing secondary osteoporosis. As shown in 6 patients of this series, incomplete RTA should be considered as another disease capable of causing osteoporosis or worsening involutional bone loss.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study, using an in vitro model, the early phases of deposition of urinary components onto the surface of calcium-salt crystals treated with physiological and alkaline urine. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Calcium carbonate, oxalate and phosphate crystals were incubated in either freshly collected 'physiological' urine (pH 5.5) or with urine at pH 8.0. The surface conditioning was characterized using sodium-dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis immunoblot profiles of the adsorbed proteins and by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Crystal morphology and aggregation were assessed using scanning electron microscopy. RESULTS: The patterns of protein adsorption from physiological urine showed the ubiquitous adsorption of bands within 51-86 kDa, while Tamm-Horsfall protein (THP) and alpha 1-microglobulin were found only in calcium oxalate crystals. Less aggregation was detected in calcium oxalate and phosphate crystals treated in urine at pH 5.5, while a new crystalline phase was deposited on calcium carbonate surfaces. Incubation in alkaline urine led to changes in the protein electrophoretic profiles, with a significant variation in the morphology of the inorganic phase only in calcium phosphate crystals. CONCLUSIONS: The binding of urinary proteins onto crystals depends on the chemistry of the surface and on the physicochemical composition of the urine. THP, albumin, alpha 1-microglobulin and a 20 kDa protein were able to bind calcium crystals under different circumstances. Except for THP, there was no clear relationship between the adsorption of proteins on crystals and the re-arrangement of the inorganic phase.

AB  - Renal tubular epithelium is the major target for oxalate induced injury, and sustained hyperoxaluria together with CaOx crystal formation/deposition may induce renal tubular cell damage and/or dysfunction. This may express itself in cell apoptosis. To evaluate the possible protective effects of certain agents (vitamin E, potassium citrate, allopurinol, verapamil and MgOH) on the presence and the severity of apoptotic changes caused by hyperoxaluria on renal tubular epithelium, an experimental study in rabbits was performed. Seventy rabbits were divided into seven different groups (each group n = 10): in group I severe hyperoxaluria was induced by continuous ethylene glycol (0.75%) administration started on day 0 and completed on day 14. Histologic alterations including crystal formation together with apoptotic changes (by using the TUNEL method) were evaluated on days 21 and 42, respectively. In the remaining experimental groups (groups II-VI), animals received some agents in addition to the induction of hyperoxaluria in an attempt to limit apoptotic changes. Group VII) animals constituted the controls. Kidneys were examined histopathologically under light microscopy for the presence and degree of crystal deposition in the tubular lumen. The percentage of apoptotic nuclei in the control group was significantly different from the other group animals (2.9-2.4%) in all study phases (P < 0.05). Apart from potassium citrate and allopurinol, the other medications seemed to prevent or limit the formation of apoptotic changes in renal tubular epithelium during the early period (day 21). The percentage of positively stained nuclei in animals undergoing potassium citrate medication ranged from 24.3% to 28.6%, with an average of 27.1%. This was 18.4% in animals receiving allopurinol. On the other hand, animals receiving magnesium hydroxide (MgOH), verapamil and vitamin E demonstrated limited apoptotic changes (11.2, 9.7, 8.7%, respectively) during this phase(P < 0.05). In the long-term (day 42), the animals receiving allopurinol and vitamin E showed a decrease in the percentage of the positively stained nuclei (13.5% and 8.3%, respectively). Animals in the other groups showed an increase in the number and percentage of apoptotic cells. Although, there was a significant decrease in the mean values of apoptosis in animals receiving vitamin E (8.7%-8.3%) and allopurinol (18.4%-13.5%) (P < 0.05), animals on verapamil, MgOH and potassium citrate medication had an increase in these values or the change was not found to be significant. In the light of our findings and results from the literature, it is clear that that both hyperoxaluria and CaOx crystals may be injurious to renal epithelial cells. Apoptotic changes observed in renal tubular epithelial cells induced by massive hyperoxaluria might result in cell degradation and may play a role in the pathologic course of urolithiasis. Again, as demonstrated in our study, the limitation of both crystal deposition and apoptotic changes might be instituted by some antioxidant agents as well as urinary inhibitors. Clinical application of such agents in the prophylaxis of stone disease might limit the formation of urinary calculi, especially in recurrent stone formers.

AB  - A 17-year-old gelding was evaluated because of dysuria, inappetence, and weight loss. Cystoscopy revealed severe mucosal ecchymoses with luminal hemorrhage and accumulations of crystalloid sludge. Analysis of a urine sample revealed isosthenuria, an alkaline pH, pyuria, hematuria, bacteriuria, and numerous calcium carbonate crystals. Histologic examination of bladder mucosa biopsy specimens revealed severe neutrophilic infiltration with mineralization. A diagnosis of encrusted cystitis exacerbated by sabulous urolithiasis was made. A Corynebacterium sp susceptible to penicillin, sulfonamide, and enrofloxacin was cultured from the urine and the bladder mucosa biopsy specimens. The horse was treated with penicillin G potassium, IV, for 5 days, followed by trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for 4 weeks. Bladder lavage was performed daily for the first 3 days with a balanced electrolyte solution and dimethyl sulfoxide in an attempt to aid expulsion of necrotic debris and crystalline sludge from the bladder. Molecular phylogenetic analysis based on the 16S rDNA gene sequence was used to identify the isolate and determine its phylogenetic position. Results indicated that the isolate was closely related to Corynebacterium matruchotii. To our knowledge, encrusted cystitis secondary to C matruchotii has not been previously identified in a horse.

AB  - Three experiments were conducted to determine the effects of excess dietary calcium carbonate, phosphorus and urine acidifying and alkalizing salts on silica urolith formation in a model using rats fed dextrose-based diets containing 2% tetraethylorthosilicate (TES). Diets containing 2% TES lowered weight gains to 91-95% of gains made by rats fed non-TES diets. Urine silica concentrations of rats fed TES were generally in the range of 50-60 mg/dl. In experiment 1, rats fed TES with no additional dietary calcium carbonate had a silica urolith incidence of 35%. With additions of 1 and 2% calcium carbonate to the basal-TES diet, respective urolith incidences were 45 and 60% (r = 0.99, P less than 0.02). In experiment 2, monobasic sodium phosphate (MP) providing 0.2% additional phosphorus resulted in a mean urine pH of 6.42 and no uroliths. Dibasic sodium phosphate (DP) without and with 0.5% sodium bicarbonate (SB) resulted in respective urine pH values of 6.78 and 7.14 and urolith incidences of 15 and 20% (MP less than DP and DP + SB, P less than 0.05). However, the uroliths were small averaging less than 1 mg. In experiment 3, substitution of autoclaved egg albumin for casein, the protein source in experiments 1 and 2, resulted in urine pH of 7.45 and a silica urolith incidence of 46%. An equal-molar mixture of MP and DP providing an added 0.2% phosphorus resulted in a urine pH of 7.07 and reduced the urolith incidence to 4%, and 0.75% of dietary ammonium chloride either with or without the added 0.2% phosphorus gave urine acidification and complete protection from uroliths.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

AB  - A large calculus developed in a renal transplant patient and was removed by pyelolithotomy. Hyperparathyroidism was not present. Important factors to consider before performing a nephrolithotomy in a transplanted kidney are whether the transplant was a right or left kidney and the timing of the operation in relation to renal function and infection. The etiology for renal stone formation in renal transplant recipients includes hyercalciuria, renal tubular acidosis, antacid administration and infection.

AB  - Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) has been carried out to analyze the organic and inorganic constituent of human urinary stones. Patient's hailing from Rajah Muthiah Medical College and Hospital, Annamalai University, Tamil Nadu, India was selected for the study. The FT-IR results indicate that stones have different composition, i.e., namely calcium oxalate, calcium phosphate, carbonate apatite and magnesium ammonium phosphate and uric acid. From the spectral and powder X-ray diffraction pattern, the chemical constituents of urinary stones were identified. The quantitative estimations of calcium oxalate monohydrate (COM) 1,620 cm(-1), calcium phosphate (apatite) 1,037 cm(-1), magnesium ammonium phosphate (struvite) 1,010 cm(-1), calcium carbonate 1,460 cm(-1) and uric acid 1,441 cm(-1) were calculated using particular peaks of FT-IR studies. The study reveals that calcium oxalate monohydrate and calcium phosphate type urinary stones were predominant whereas magnesium ammonium phosphate are in moderate level, and calcium carbonate and uric acid are in low. Calcium phosphate is found in all the stones and calcium oxalate monohydrate is found to be higher. Quantitative analyses of urinary stones show that calcium oxalate monohydrate (40%), apatite (30%), magnesium ammonium phosphate (23%) and uric acid (7%) are present in all the urinary stone samples.

AB  - Experience with chemodissolution of uric acid stones in 30 patients is presented. Chemodissolution was achieved either with infusion of 0.16 M i.v. lactate or oral sodium bicarbonate, in addition to liberal fluid intake and allopurinol wherever indicated. In some cases direct chemodissolution by in situ irrigation with sodium bicarbonate solution was done after an initial percutaneous nephrostomy. Seven patients presented with acute obstructive anuria. In this group, 5 of them had bilateral obstructive calculi, while 2 had unilateral obstruction in a solitary kidney. The latter 2 had complete recovery following intravenous lactate therapy. Of the 5 presenting with bilateral obstruction, 2 patients had complete response to chemodissolution, whereas the remaining 3 had only a partial response requiring surgery for ultimate salvage. In this group I, 6 patients are doing well with a normal serum creatinine at 3 months to 4 years follow-up, while 1 patient has a serum creatinine, stabilised at 3.2 mg%. In the second group, 23 patients presented with non-obstructing urinary stones. Flank pain was the commonest complaint and a concomitant history of gout was present in 6 patients. Hyperuricaemia was detected in 12 and hyperuricosuria in 19. All cases were managed by high fluid intake and oral sodium bicarbonate, with self-monitoring of urine pH, which was kept between 6.5 and 7.0. Allopurinol was administered in cases having hyperuricaemia and/or hyperuricosuria. Systemic alkali therapy in the form of intravenous molar lactate or sodium bicarbonate is effective and safe both in obstructive anuria and non-obstructive urinary uric acid stones.

AB  - PURPOSE: Uric acid calculi with or without a calcium component comprise a significant proportion of urinary stones. Knowledge of the pathophysiology of stone formation is important to direct medical treatment. The aim of this review is to provide an update on the epidemiology, pathophysiology and management of uric acid renal stones. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A MEDLINE search was performed on the topic of uric acid stones. Current literature was reviewed with regard to the epidemiology, pathophysiology, associated medical conditions and management of uric acid stones. RESULTS: The incidence of uric acid stones varies between countries and accounts for 5% to 40% of all urinary calculi. Hyperuricuria, low urinary output and acidic urine are well known contributing factors. However, the most important factor for uric acid stone formation is persistently acidic urine. Gout and myeloproliferative disorders are associated with uric acid stones. Why most patients with gout present with acidic urine yet only 20% have uric acid stone formation remains unclear. The pathophysiological basis for persistent urine acidity also remains unclear although various mechanisms have been proposed. Urinary alkalization with potassium citrate or sodium bicarbonate is a highly effective treatment, resulting in dissolution of existing stones and prevention of recurrence. CONCLUSIONS: Acidic urine is a prerequisite for uric acid stone formation and growth. Medical management with urinary alkalization for stone dissolution and prevention of recurrence is effective and should be the cornerstone of treatment.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Orthopaedic surgeons prefer calcium supplement for various pathologies like fracture, osteoporosis, chronic musculoskeletal pain, yet there is no proper evidence to support the benefits of taking them regularly. The average requirement for calcium is around 500-1000 mg/day for a healthy adult, this amount of calcium is not achieved by diet, especially in developing countries like India. Despite this, the serum calcium level remains unaltered, due to the well-controlled absorption and excretion of calcium by the human body. As there is no clarity over the dose, duration and the prefered calcium salts, we constructed a survey to find the preferred dose, duration, the preferred calcium salts among orthopaedic surgeons, and to give an in-depth review of literature about dose, duration, timing, preferred calcium salt and various other calcium-related queries. MATERIALS AND METHOD: The survey included 15 pre-structured questionnaires; these questions were formatted and validated by senior surgeons and other specialists after a through a review of calcium-related literature. These questionnaires were used in a pilot study conducted within the department and were later modified and separated into 7 sections. Data were collected by both online survey (google forms) and direct interviews. RESULT AND CONCLUSION: 128 Orthopedic surgeons responded. The total number of response obtained was 2355. Unanswered questions were 152. From the survey, it was found that most orthopaedic surgeons prefer to prescribe calcium routinely (55.46%). The commonly used calcium salt was calcium carbonate (47.65%), followed by citrate (32.8%). 42.18% were not aware of the efficiency of prescribing calcium in divided doses. Most responded that calcium is not to be given for patients with renal stones, but literature shows that calcium prescribed reduces the recurrence of commonest kidney stones, calcium oxalate stones.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: This cross-sectional study aims to evaluate the association between calcium and vitamin D supplementation for osteoporosis treatment and the development of kidney stones while investigating the impact of urinary calcium excretion on kidney stone risk among patients receiving this supplementation treatment. DESIGN: The study involved collecting data from 204 Chinese Han patients aged 50-89 with osteoporosis in the southwest region of China. These patients had been on daily doses of 600 mg of calcium carbonate and 0.5 microg alfacalcidol for at least 1 year. The study employed univariate analysis and multivariable logistic regression to identify risk factors for kidney stones, with independent t-tests used to compare differences between groups. SETTING: Data were collected from patients in the southwest region of China, covering the period from July 2019 to December 2023. PARTICIPANTS: The study included 204 patients with osteoporosis, all of whom had been receiving the specified calcium and vitamin D supplements for the duration of the study. RESULTS: The study found that a history of recurrent kidney stones was an independent risk factor for the development of kidney stones. Patients with kidney stones who had a history of recurrent stones exhibited significantly higher levels of 24-hour urinary calcium excretion (1.00+/-0.62 vs 0.57+/-0.54, p=0.026) compared with those without such a history. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that a history of recurrent kidney stones independently increases the risk of kidney stones in patients undergoing calcium and vitamin D supplementation for osteoporosis, likely due to increased urinary calcium excretion.

AB  - PURPOSE: To document the experiences of a single institution in evaluating the clinical courses and treatment outcomes of patients with cystine stones. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The clinical data of 14 patients with cystine stones who were treated at our institution from March 1994 to July 2012 were reviewed. These data included age at first visit, gender, family history, body mass index, presence of a single kidney, stone locations, stone burden, routine urinalysis, and culture. In addition, we also analyzed data on surgery, shock wave lithotripsy, medical treatment, stone recurrence or regrowth, and overall treatment success rates. RESULTS: The mean age of our patients at their first visit was 19.6+/-5.0 years, and eight patients were males. The median stone burden and mean urine pH before each surgery were 6.5 cm(2) and 6.5+/-0.9, respectively. Two patients had a family history of cystine stones. Patients underwent surgery an average of 2.7 times. The median interval between surgeries was 27.3 months, and 1 open surgery, 12 percutaneous nephrolithotomies, and 25 ureterorenoscopies were performed. Potassium citrate or sodium bicarbonate was used in nine cases. D-Penicillamine was continuously used in three patients. Patients had an average incidence of 3.2 recurrences or regrowth of stones during the median follow-up period of 60.5 months. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with cystine stones have high recurrence or regrowth rates and relatively large stone burdens. Adequate treatment schedules must therefore be established in these cases to prevent possible deterioration of renal function.

AB  - We report a case of urolithiasis caused by surgical treatment for Crohn's disease. A 28-year-old woman was referred to our department for further examination of renal stones from the medical department in September, 1995. She suffered from Crohn's disease and had a history of jejuno-ileal resection because of perforation of the ileum in 1988. Radiographs revealed multiple bilateral renal stones, and the urine oxalate concentration was elevated. She was treated with extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy and the administration of sodium bicarbonate and citrate, but these treatments did not prevent recurrence and enlargement of stones. Renal function was gradually worsened and we performed transurethral lithotomy and percutaneous nephrolithotripsy. The stones were mainly composed of oxalate calcium monohydrate. A renal biopsy was performed at the operation, showing deposition of crystals in almost all renal tubules. Diet therapy (low oxalate and low fat) and the administration of sodium bicarbonate and citrate were performed strictly and recurrence was not recognized 10 months after complete removal of the stones.

AB  - Two sets of animal experiments using guinea pigs were planned to evaluate the effect of ascorbic acid supplementation on the lithogenic process. In the first set of experiments, 10, 40, and 60 mg doses of ascorbic acid/100g body weight/day were given for 105 days. Neither of the ascorbic acid doses given induced crystalluria, calcification or stone formation, thereby confirming our previous findings that ascorbic acid in the doses used by clinicians does not cause urolith formation. In the second set of experiments, ascorbic acid was supplemented in hypercalciuric (induced by calcium carbonate feeding) and hyperoxaluric (induced by sodium oxalate feeding) animals for 45 days. The results indicated that it exacerbated the calcification process in renal and bladder tissue.

AB  - AIM: To compare efficacy and tolerability of phytotherapy (PT) vs. potassium citrate (KC) in patients with minimal nephrolithiasis. To compare and assess changes in value of certain serum (Ca(2)+, PO(4) (3-), uric acid [UA]) and urinary (24-hr Ca(2+), PO(4) (3-), UA, citrate, oxalate, and urine pH) parameters in patients being treated with PT or KC. MATERIALS AND METHODS: After clearance by the local institutional ethics committee, 60 patients of nephrolithiasis who had consented for the study, were enrolled (as per entry criteria) and randomized into citrate therapy (group-I) or PT (group-II). PT was administered as a nutritional supplement, using a lupeol-based extract (Tablet Calcury, two tablets twice a day). They were monitored for the changes in the serum and urinary biochemical, radiological, and clinical parameters (efficacy and tolerability) as per protocol. RESULTS: Group-I patients demonstrated favorable changes in certain biochemical parameters (decreased serum calcium, urinary UA/oxalate, increased urinary citrate and pH) along with significant symptomatic improvement (decrease in visual analogue pain score with increased stone clearance/reduction in stone size). Four (13.3%) patients of group-I had mild upper gastrointestinal discomfort which was controlled with antacids. Group-II patients had favorable changes in biochemical parameters (decreased serum UA and increased urinary citrate) along with significant symptomatic improvement (reduction/clearance in the stone size), but without any noticeable side effects. CONCLUSIONS: Medical therapies with both KC and PT (with lupeol extract using Calcury) were effective in reducing the stone size and symptoms of nephrolithiasis. It appeared that KC was biochemically efficacious in producing some favorable biochemical changes with some side effects, whereas PT was probably clinically efficacious in hastening stone expulsion (<8 mm) without any observed adverse events. Although both the medical therapies were not effective in all aspects, we believe that PT using lupeol-based extract (Calcury) may be used as an alternative form of medical therapy in select patients with minimal nephrolithiasis. Long-term randomized placebo-controlled trials are needed to better define the precise role of lupeol-based PT vs. citrate therapy in minimal nephrolithiasis.

AB  - PURPOSE: In this paper we present our experience with dissolution therapy of radiolucent calculi. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a retrospective analysis of patients who were offered urinary dissolution therapy between January 2010 and June 2011. Patients were treated with tablets containing potassium citrate and magnesium oxide. Partial dissolution was defined as at least a 50% reduction in stone size. Patients with complete or partial dissolution were classified in the successful dissolution group. Patients with no change, inadequate reduction, increase in stone size and those unable to tolerate alkali therapy were classified as failures. Patient sex, stenting before alkalinization, stone size, urine pH at presentation and serum uric acid levels were analyzed using Fisher t-test for an association with successful dissolution. RESULTS: Out of 67, 48 patients reported for follow up. 10 (15%) had complete dissolution and 13 (19%) had partial dissolution. Alkalinization was unsuccessful in achieving dissolution in 25 (37%). Stenting before alkalinization, patient weight (< 60 vs. > 75kg) and serum uric acid levels (</= 6 vs. > 6) were the only factors to significantly affected dissolution rates (p = 0.039, p 0.035, p 0.01 respectively). CONCLUSIONS: A policy of offering dissolution therapy to patients with radiolucent calculi had a successful outcome in 34% of patients.

AB  - The aim of this study was to validate the method for analyzing the composition of calculus using infrared (IR) spectroscopy by studying model mixtures of salts. Study was made with an ALPHA-P IR Fourier spectrometer with OPUS software (Bruker, Germany). The samples of pure chemical salts manufactured by Sigma-Aldrich USA were used to validate the method. Salt mixtures were prepared in ratios of 10/90, 50/50 and 90/10. To assess the effect of the fraction size on the calculus component results, were used calculi of patients with urolithiasis. For each mixture were used 10 repeated measurements. Analysis of the composition of model salts showed that in the study of pure cystine salt CV(%) was 0,79%, calcium carbonate - 0,92%, sodium urate - 0,97%, calcium oxalate monohydrate - 4,94%, magnesium ammonium phosphate - 5,59%. And the most common components were analyzed in the composition of complex mixtures, including 90%, 50% and 10% of the investigated component. Calcium oxalate monohydrate has CV(%) 5.70% in mixture 9 part of it to one part of impurities, in mixture 50/50 - 21.57% and in 10/90 - 5.70%. For uric acid in 90/10 - 2.20%, in 50/50 - 10.09%, in 10/90 - 31.94%. For calcium carbonate in 90/10 - 9.02%, in 50/50 - 11.98%, in 10/90 - 24.70%. The dispersion analysis showed that the weighed portions of salts with a particle diameter of more than 0.8 mm provide reproducibility with a CV - 11.48%, with a diameter of 0.2-0.8 mm - 5.35%, and finally less than 0.1 mm - 2.28%. The accuracy of the method is high, but the reproducibility of the IR-spectroscopy method is relatively low in the analysis of stones of mixed composition, due to the greater error in the determination of impurities. Laboratories should pay special attention to optimizing sample preparation to ensure particle fineness less than 0.1 mm.

AB  - Calculus formation in the renal transplanted patient is uncommon and usually represents a late complication of secondary hyperparathyroidism. A case report of a gouty patient with a transplanted cadaveric kidney is presented. The patient presented without hypercalcemia, or urinary infection, or renal tubular acidosis, or ureteral obstruction, or ingestion of antacids, or metabolic disease, or previous graft lithiasis. Five months after transplantation, a large stone within the renal pelvis was observed on an x-ray film. The radiotransparent nucleus, the patient's past history and the acute gouty arthritis he presented in the immediate postoperative period suggested that the nucleus of the calculus might be mainly composed of uric acid. These facts have drawn our attention to the control of the purine metabolism in the renal transplanted patients who have a past history consistent with gout.

AB  - Two previous studies (<10 patients each) have demonstrated that alkali therapy may reduce urine calcium excretion in patients with calcium oxalate nephrolithiasis. The hypothesized mechanisms are (1) a decrease in bone turnover due to systemic alkalinization by the medications; (2) binding of calcium by citrate in the gastrointestinal tract; (3) direct effects on TRPV5 activity in the distal tubule. We performed a retrospective review of patients on potassium citrate therapy to evaluate the effects of this medication on urinary calcium excretion. A retrospective review was performed of a metabolic stone database at a tertiary care academic hospital. Patients were identified with a history of calcium oxalate nephrolithiasis and hypocitraturia who were on potassium citrate therapy for a minimum of 3 months. 24-h urine composition was assessed prior to the initiation of potassium citrate therapy and after 3 months of therapy. Patients received 30-60 mEq potassium citrate by mouth daily. Inclusion criterion was a change in urine potassium of 20 mEq/day or greater, which suggests compliance with potassium citrate therapy. Paired t test was used to compare therapeutic effect. Twenty-two patients were evaluated. Mean age was 58.8 years (SD 14.0), mean BMI was 29.6 kg/m(2) (SD 5.9), and gender prevalence was 36.4% female:63.6% male. Mean pre-treatment 24-h urine values were as follows: citrate 280.0 mg/day, potassium 58.7 mEq/day, calcium 216.0 mg/day, pH 5.87. Potassium citrate therapy was associated with statistically significant changes in each of these parameters-citrate increased to 548.4 mg/day (p < 0.0001), potassium increased to 94.1 mEq/day (p < 0.0001), calcium decreased to 156.5 mg/day (p = 0.04), pH increased to 6.47 (p = 0.001). Urine sodium excretion was not different pre- and post-therapy (175 mEq/day pre-therapy versus 201 mEq/day post-therapy, p = NS). Urinary calcium excretion decreased by a mean of 60 mg/day on potassium citrate therapy-a nearly 30 % decrease in urine calcium excretion. These data lend support to the hypothesis that alkali therapy reduces urine calcium excretion.

AB  - Two patients are described who presented with complete urinary obstruction secondary to nonopaque uric acid stones. They were treated with percutaneous nephrostomy for urinary diversion and urinary alkalinization by local irrigation and oral sodium bicarbonate therapy with complete dissolution of the stone after 16 and 21 days of therapy. Percutaneous nephrostomy with urinary alkalinization is a reasonable, relatively safe alternative to surgical stone removal for patients with obstructing uric acid stones.

AB  - A 2 1/4 year-old boy was treated for cystinuria and urolithiasis with high fluid intake, sodium bicarbonate, and D-penicillamine, over a period of 5 3/4 years, unauthorized interruptions and prescribed pauses included. Therapy was partially sucessful but regrowth of calculi coincided with interruptions of D-penicillamine administration and also with the institution of a low-dose D-penicillamine regime. Flat feet, scoliosis, pectus carinatum, hypermobility of joints, molluscoid pseudotumors and atrophic scars were alarming side effects of D-penicillamine. However, the possibility was not excluded that a forme fruste of an Ehlers-Danlos syndrome preexisted in this boy and was effected by D-penicillamine. Only the molluscoid pseudotumors regressed when D-penicillamine was reduced or omitted temporarily. Osteolathyrism caused by D-penicillamine has hitherto not been reported in man.

AB  - Introduction: Kidney stones affect 1 in every 11 people in the United States each year. There is a significant high recurrence rate without a stone prevention protocol. Alkali citrate is beneficial in decreasing stone recurrence, but because of the cost and gastrointestinal side effects there is a low adherence rate. This study aims to serve as a review of some of the most commonly used alkalizing over-the-counter supplements that are advertised to prevent and treat kidney stones. Methods: Data were gathered by a comprehensive online literature search and company inquiries for kidney stone prevention supplements. An additional informal poll of the authors selected supplements that are most commonly taken by their patients. A total of eight supplements were evaluated for cost, alkali equivalent provided, dosing, and regulatory information. Results: Eight of the most commonly used supplements were reviewed with a focus on alkalizing agents. Information reviewed revealed dosing recommendations resulting in decreased citrate alkali equivalents per day compared with prescription-strength potassium citrate. Cost, peer-reviewed study results, and regulatory data were reviewed, tabulated, and analyzed. Cost per alkali equivalent was substantially decreased for each supplement compared with the prescribed drug. All supplements were found to be readily available online. Conclusion: Over-the-counter alkalizing agents are available to patients and may be an appropriate alternative to cost-prohibitive potassium citrate when treating urolithiasis patients. Additional testing will be necessary in the future to determine the efficacy of these supplements in the treatment and prevention of urinary stone disease.

AB  - Sheep were used to study factors previously found to promote silica urolithiasis in a rat model. In addition to high silica, these dietary factors included elevated calcium, a high calcium to phosphorus ratio and alkali-forming effects. Wether lambs had ad libitum access to a diet of 50% of grass hay and 50% ground oats plus supplement. Diet analysis was 3.4% total SiO2, .29% calcium, .25% phosphorus, 11.3% CP and 28% ADF. Treatments (40 lambs/treatment) consisted of a control (C), limestone to increase dietary calcium to .6% (L), L + 1% sodium bicarbonate (LS) and L + 1% ammonium chloride (LA). After a 91-d experimental period followed by a 56-d postexperimental finishing period, silica kidney deposits were found in all treatments, and SiO2 made up 74% to 97% of the urolithic ash. Kidney urolith incidences in the four treatments were C, 7/40; L, 12/40; LS, 20/40; and LA, 9/40. A higher urolith incidence in LS (LS vs C, P less than .05) and a trend toward a higher incidence in L (L vs C, P less than .2), accompanied by elevated urine pH (L = LS greater than C greater than LA, P less than .01), lend support to the concept that high-silica diets having high calcium to phosphorus ratios and alkali-forming potentials contribute to silica urolithiasis.

AB  - The recent development of gallstone fragmentation methods has increased the significance of the study of the mechanical properties of human gallstones. In the present work, fracture strength data and microhardness values of gallstones of various chemical compositions are presented as tested in both dry and simulated bile environments. Generally, both gallstone hardness and fracture strength values were significantly less than kidney stone values found in previous studies. However, a single calcium carbonate stone was found to have an outer shell hardness exceeding those values found for kidney stones. Diametral compression measurements in simulated bile conclusively demonstrated low gallstone fracture strength as well as brittle fracture in the stones tested. Based on the results of this study, one may conclude that the wide range of gallstone microhardnesses found may explain the reported difficulties previous investigators have experienced using various fragmentation techniques on specific gallstones. Moreover, gallstone mechanical properties may be relatively sensitive to bile-environment composition.

AB  - METHOD: Eighteen hospitalized patients with candiduria were treated with oral potassium-sodium-hydrogen citrate to alkalinize the urine. The results obtained were compared with those observed in an untreated retrospective control group. Dosage was adjusted in accordance with the pH of the urine measured immediately before treatment with the aim of achieving a pH of 7 to 7.5. RESULTS: All patients had an indwelling catheter, which is a predisposing factor for candiduria. In 16 out of 18 patients (89%) treatment with potassium-sodium-hydrogen citrate raised pH and resulted in the disappearance of candiduria. Duration of treatment varied between two days and one month (mean: seven days). In four patients the urine became completely sterile; during treatment 12 out of 18 patients developed significant bacteriuria (in eight cases of these the indwelling catheter had been left in place). CONCLUSIONS: Alkalinization of the urine is a simple and effective method of treating candiduria in patients with an indwelling catheter. An additional advantage is the metaphylaxis and prophylaxis of renal stone formation in immobilized patients.

AB  - Most Americans do not meet the adequate intake (AI) for calcium; calcium supplements can help meet requirements. Calcium supplementation has been found to be beneficial for bone health in children, young adults, and menopausal women. In addition to calcium, vitamin D is necessary for bone health and is generally deficient in the industrialized world. Calcium from carbonate and citrate are the most common forms of calcium supplements. Calcium carbonate, the most cost-effective form, should be taken with a meal to ensure optimal absorption. Calcium citrate can be taken without food and is the supplement of choice for individuals with achlorhydria or who are taking histamine-2 blockers or protein-pump inhibitors. Calcium lactate and calcium gluconate are less concentrated forms of calcium and are not practical oral supplements. Research on hydroxyapatite as a source of calcium is limited, so this form of calcium is not recommended. The maximum dose of elemental calcium that should be taken at a time is 500 mg. U.S. Pharmacopeia-verified calcium supplements meet vigorous manufacturing and quality requirements. Absorption from calcium-fortified beverages varies and in general is not equal to that of milk. Potential adverse effects of calcium supplementation include gastrointestinal complaints. Renal calculi in most studies have not been associated with calcium supplementation. The risk of advanced and fatal prostate cancer has been associated with calcium intakes from food or supplements in amounts >1500 mg/d.

AB  - Silicate urinary calculi are rare in humans, with an incidence of 0.2% of all urinary calculi. Most cases were related to excess ingestion of silicate, typically by taking magnesium trisilicate as an antacid for peptic ulcers over a long period of time; however, there also existed unrelated cases, whose mechanism of development remains unclear. On the other hand, zonisamide, a newer antiepileptic drug, is one of the important causing agents of iatrogenic urinary stones in patients with epilepsy. The supposed mechanism is that zonisamide induces urine alkalinization and then promotes crystallization of urine components such as calcium phosphate by inhibition of carbonate dehydratase in renal tubular epithelial cells. Here, we report a case of silicate urolithiasis during long-term treatment with zonisamide without magnesium trisilicate intake and discuss the etiology of the disease by examining the silicate concentration in his urine.

AB  - Fourteen pancreatic calculi from the corresponding number of pancreatic lithiasis patients were examined mineralogically and histochemically. The following results were obtained. The main components of calculi were calcium carbonate in 13 of the 14 cases, and calcium phosphate in the remaining one. Calcium carbonate calculi were all so-called intraductal calculi, with acidic glycoprotein apparently enwrapping the component particles. Acidic glycoproteins acted to bridge calcium carbonate particles, as in the cases of gallstone and urinary stone. The calcium phosphate calculus had a histochemical feature of pathologic calcification with degenerated collagen fibrils as the matrix, suggesting the calcification of the fibrotic pancreatic parenchyma after pancreatitis.

AB  - Osteomalacia is a systemic metabolic bone disease. Hypophosphatemia is one of the most important causes of impaired mineralization. Here, we describe a case of osteomalacia associated with atypical renal tubular acidosis. A 43-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital due to sustained unrelieved bilateral flank pain. She had a history of fragile fracture with vitamin D deficiency and had been treated with active vitamin D. On admission, she presented with hypophosphatemia, hypocalcemia, high bone-specific alkaline phosphatase level, bone pain, and low bone mineral density. Multiple areas of uptake were also confirmed by bone scintigraphy, and she was diagnosed with osteomalacia. An increased dose of alfacalcidol was initiated for her vitamin D deficiency; her symptoms remained unstable and unrelieved. Her blood gas examination revealed metabolic acidosis without an increase in the anion gap (HCO(3)(-) 11.8 mEq/L, anion gap 3.2 mEq/L). Tubular dysfunction, tubular damage, kidney stones, and inadequate urinary acidification were all observed, suggesting the presence of renal tubular acidosis from a combination of both distal and proximal origin. She also had overt proteinuria, decreased renal function, and hypothalamic hypogonadism. In addition to alfacalcidol, sodium bicarbonate and oral phosphorus supplementation were initiated. After this prescription, her pain dramatically improved in association with the restoration of acid-base balance and electrolytes; renal dysfunction and proteinuria were unaltered. This case indicated that careful assessments of tubular function and acid-base balance are essential for the management of osteomalacia in addition to the evaluation of the calcium/phosphate balance and vitamin D status.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Urinary silicate calculi in humans are extremely rare. Reported cases of silicate calculi are mostly documented in adults and are commonly related to an excessive intake of magnesium trisilicate in food or drugs. Published studies on the presence of silicate calculi in children are scarce. CASES: Three cases of silicate kidney stones without prior silicate intake are reported. Two patients underwent surgical treatment, and the third patient was treated using conservative methods. Urinalysis revealed no underlying metabolic abnormalities. Analyses revealed that silicate was the major component of the stones. CONCLUSION: Siliceous deposits in urinary stones may be more common than anticipated, and the underlying pathophysiology remains to be clarified.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Type 1 (distal) renal tubular acidosis (RTA) is a rare clinical condition characterized with defect of urinary acidification in distal tubulus. If diagnosis delays, RTA may cause metabolic and clinical complications and comorbidities. We describe here a type 1 distal RTA case with symptoms mimicking coronary ischemia. CASE REPORT: A 46-year-old woman admitted with complaints of chest pain, palpitation, walking disability, fatigue and nausea. On physical examination muscles were weaken 3/5 in four extremities. An electrocardiogram revealed supraventricular tachycardia and ST depression on precordial V2-6 derivations. An acute coronary syndrome diagnosis made based on anginal symptoms, supraventricular tachycardia, ST depression on V2-6 derivations and elevated cardiac enzymes. Urgent coronary angiography was normal except a 30% narrowing in LAD. She had recurrent nephrolithiasis and had operated because of hydronephrosis. She had two episodes of fatigue and walking disability previously. Hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis with normal anion gap determined in blood gas analyze. Patient diagnosed with type I RTA with the signs and symptoms of recurrent nephrolithiasis, fatigue, severe hypokalemia (1.8 mmol/L), hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis with normal anionic gap, alkaline urine (pH 8) and positive urinary anionic gap (13.7 mmol/L). Sodium bicarbonate infusion and potassium replacement therapy administered. Clinical and laboratory signs of the patient dissolved during treatment. CONCLUSION: Type 1 RTA should be considered in acidotic patients admitted with hypokalemia and coronary symptoms. Urinary and blood gas analyses should be done beside cardiac tests initially. Therefore, a precise diagnosis may be possible without the possible complications of unnecessary coronary interventions.

AB  - Thirty-six Australian Aboriginal children with urolithiasis were reviewed. Males dominated the series. The age distribution ranged from 8 months to 12 years and nearly 70% were 2 years or younger. Thirty-five patients had upper tract stones. Ultrasound was diagnostic in 35 patients and was falsely negative in one. Dietary factors, dehydration and recurrent diarrhoea are incriminated in the aetiology, because ammonium urate and oxalate were the main constituents of the stones. Malformations of the urinary tract were rare and known metabolic disorders were not seen. Chemical dissolution of the stones was found to be a safe and effective adjuvant in the management of urate stones.

AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the impact of ureteral stenting on the success rate of oral chemolysis in the management of suspected uric acid upper urinary tract (UUT) stones. METHODS: Retrospective matched-pair analysis of 172 patients treated with oral chemolysis from 01/2010 to 12/2019. Patients with low density (upon non-contrast enhanced computer tomography [NCCT]), radiolucent (on plain radiography) urinary stones, a low urine pH (< 6) and/or history of uric acid urolithiasis were included. Potassium citrate and/or sodium bicarbonate were used for alkalization (target urine pH: 6.5-7.2). Patient 1:1 matching was performed for the presence of indwelling ureteral stent, stone diameter, stone density, and stone localization. Stone-free status was evaluated after 12 weeks using NCCT. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to assess factors affecting the outcome. RESULTS: Mean patient age was 61 years (73% males). Mean stone size was 12 mm. Overall success rates after 12-weeks of chemolysis for stones at any localization in the UUT and ureteral stones were 60.5 and 77.3%, respectively. Smaller stone size (OR = 0.94; CI 0.888-0.992; p = 0.026) and lower pre-treatment urine pH (OR = 0.131; CI 0.023-0.737; p = 0.021) significantly increased the success of oral chemolysis. Ureteral stenting did not have any impact on the efficacy of oral chemolysis. CONCLUSION: Oral chemolysis is an effective treatment modality for patients with UUT stones suspected of uric acid content irrespective of ureteral stenting. Smaller stone diameter and lower urine pH at diagnosis increase its efficacy.

AB  - This paper illustrates one of the more satisfying aspects of the treatment of urinary calculous disease. A small series of 8 patients is presented to emphasize the possibility of dissolving uric acid stones by conservative measures thereby saving the patients extensive and often destructive surgical procedures. Patient selection is important for successful therapy. The stone must not be calcified and there must be sufficient function in the kidney. The regime consists of allopurinol 100 mg and sodium bicarbonate 2 to 4 grams given orally three times a day. Treatment period lasted up to six months, with dissolution of stones.

AB  - Hematuria is a frequent complication in burn patients, but its clinical significance has not been reported. The incidence, etiologies, treatment, and outcome of hematuria in 1,785 burn patients treated from 1964 to 1983, have been reviewed. Ninety-one patients had hematuria (greater than 15 RBC/HPF with unspun urine). There were five main causes: urinary infections (UTI), 50 cases; renal calculi (RC), 14 cases, including 3% and 5% total body surface area burn patients; catheter trauma, 7 cases; renal vein thrombosis (RVT), 5 cases; and acute renal failure (ATN), 4 cases. Ten patients died in the UTI group, five with Candida as the infecting organism. No RC patients died, but two required surgical extraction of their stones. This incidence of RC may be due to large intake of dairy products and antacids and to prolonged immobilization. The catheter trauma group had no deaths and was the youngest group. One RVT patient was diagnosed clinically and successfully treated surgically. The other three were diagnosed at necropsy. The ATN patients all developed renal failure late as part of multiple organ system failure and all died. We conclude hematuria is a serious finding in burn patients and prompt diagnosis of its etiology and treatment are essential for maintaining renal function and patient survival.

AB  - A 54-year-old woman was admitted to our department with the diagnosis of a renal calculus. She exhibited dull left flank pain. A plain film revealed a round opaque calcific density in the left kidney in the supine and the upright position. There was no connection between the calcification and the renal collecting system by retrograde pyelography. Computed tomography in the supine position showed a rounded calcification in the left renal parenchyma without a semilunar configuration. She was diagnosed with left renal calyceal diverticula calculi. She underwent a surgical intervention which found a renal milky stone including a 10-mm. diameter stone. The examination of the fluid and the stone material disclosed three components: calcium phosphate, calcium oxalate and calcium carbonate. The present case is interesting because its characteristics differ from the common features of renal milky stone.

AB  - Etiological factors and pathogenetic mechanisms were studied in 538 patients with nephrolithiasis. By composition of uroliths and salts, all the patients were divided into groups by types of urolithiasis (oxalate, urate, phosphate, cystic and mixed). After elimination of the uroliths using different methods, metaphylaxis of nephrolithiasis was conducted in all the patients. It varied with type of lithogenesis, etiology and pathogenesis. Antirecurrence therapy included diet with restriction of lithogenic substances, endogenic reduction of lithogenic metabolites and measures to decrease and block crystallization and lithogenesis. The treatment has diminished the incidence of recurrences from 32.3 to 9.6% (total), from 14.4 to 5.3% (in oxalate type), 47.2 to 16.9% (in phosphate type), 39.7 to 6.7% (in urate type), 40.5 to 17.7% (in mixed type).

AB  - BACKGROUND: While in vitro the protective effect of magnesium on calcium oxalate crystallization is well known, its clinical relevance in calcium nephrolithiasis is still debated. Therefore, the clinical and metabolic effects of magnesium hydroxide therapy were evaluated in calcium stone formers. METHODS: Nine patients (7 M, 2 F), selected for a low urinary magnesium excretion (uMg 56 +/- 12 mg/day), were given Mg hydroxide (500 mg/day), with clinical and metabolic controls at 3, 12 and 18 months. RESULTS: Urinary Mg/uCreat increased throughout the study; uOx/uCreat decreased significantly; uCa/uCreat increased but not significantly. The stone recurrence rate decreased from 0.75 to 0.11 stones/year/patient, throughout the study period. The decrease of uOx is considered a more important risk factor in calcium stone patients than a similar uCa change; it may be due to a reduced intestinal Ox absorption, for the formation of insoluble and not absorbed Mg oxalate. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, Mg hydroxide therapy was encouraging in patients with calcium nephrolithiasis and low uMg; nevertheless a longer period of treatment is needed to confirm these data.

AB  - Milk of calcium is a viscous colloidal suspension of calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate, or calcium oxalate, or a mixture of these compounds. The calcific material gravitates to the dependent portion of a cystic cavity. Crescent- or hemisphere-shaped calcium density with a sharp horizontal upper border at the milk of calcium-clear fluid interface confirms the diagnosis. Bilateral milk of calcium in the renal pelvis or in dilated calyces is very rare and has not been reported in patients with spinal cord injury. A 63-year-old male patient with T-10 paraplegia presented with recurrent urinary tract infections. X-ray of the kidneys, taken with the vertical beam while the patient lay supine, revealed a poorly defined opacity overlying the lower pole of the right kidney. Findings on ultrasonography of the kidneys were interpreted as a large, staghorn-type calculus in the dilated lower pole calyx of the right kidney. Because x-ray of the kidneys showed a poorly defined opacity overlying the lower pole of the right kidney, milk of calcium was suspected, and computed tomography (CT) of the kidneys was performed. Calcific debris with horizontal layering in the lower pole calyces of both kidneys was seen; this confirmed the diagnosis of milk of calcium. A 62-year-old female patient with C-7 tetraplegia underwent ileal conduit urinary diversion. Subsequently, she developed calculi in the right kidney, which were treated with shock wave lithotripsy. Follow-up x-ray revealed faintly opaque shadows with indistinct margins in the region of both kidneys. Intravenous urography showed cortical thinning at the upper poles and blunting of the calyces, suggestive of chronic pyelonephritis. The right renal pelvis was bulky, and bilateral renal calculi were diagnosed during ultrasonography; however, the presence of faintly radio-opaque shadows with indistinct margins raised suspicions of renal milk of calcium. A CT scan of the kidneys, which was performed in the supine and subsequently in the prone position, revealed gravity-dependent layering of calcific material in the pelves of both kidneys and in the midpole calyces of the right kidney, thus confirming the diagnosis of milk of calcium. In conclusion, CT scan of the kidneys confirmed the diagnosis of bilateral renal milk of calcium, a very rare entity in patients with spinal cord injury. Awareness of typical and unique features of milk of calcium during imaging enables physicians to recognize renal milk of calcium and to differentiate it from nephrolithiasis, thereby avoiding unwarranted interventions such as shock wave lithotripsy or endoscopic procedures.

AB  - Milk of calcium renal stone refers to an entity described in connection to a similar condition in gallbladder disease. The intrarenal accumulation of calcium carbonate imitates a calcific density and frequently is located within a caliceal diverticulum or a pyelogenic cyst. Symptomatology, if present, mainly refers to a continuous flank distress but colicky pain complaints are rare. The diagnosis is radiological. The typical impression of a shifting fluid level is apparent when comparing x-rays with the patient in the supine position, and in the upright and lateral projections. When extracorporeal shock waves are applied on this target no fragmentation is achieved. Although the calcium content will account for a difference in acoustical impedance, neither a cleavage nor a fracture plane can be generated within the fluid calcium salt deposits.

AB  - Previous in vitro experiments demonstrated the reduced microhardness of calcium oxalate monohydrate (COM) calculi, relative to dry values, when saturated with an alkaline solution (pH = 9.5). Nineteen patients with a COM calculus in the distal ureter which had been resistant to prior extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy in situ, were treated when the stone was surrounded by alkaline urine. The urine of 14 patients was alkalinized orally by administration of acetazolamine and citrate solution; in 5 other patients direct percutaneous irrigation of sodium bicarbonate via a nephrostomy tube was carried out. The urinary pH just before lithotripsy was greater than or equal to 9 in 17/19 patients. 4,000 shock waves, averaging 18.1 kV generated by the Siemens Lithostar, were delivered onto the calculus. No significant increase of comminution rate was apparent at radiographic control immediately after the treatment and only in half of the cases was evacuation obtained within 3 months.

AB  - Pancreatic juice is supersaturated in calcium carbonate. CaCO3 crystal growth is controlled by lithostathine, a secretory protein synthesized by pancreatic acinar cells, first described as a constituent of pancreatic stones. It was recently reported that, in the thin descending limb of the Henle's loop, urine was supersaturated in CaCO3 (Coe FL, Parks JH: Defenses of an unstable compromise: crystallization inhibitors and the kidney's role in mineral regulation. Kidney Int. 1990: 38, 625-631. This observation suggested the presence in kidney of a similar inhibitor. In this study, we show that a protein immunologically related to lithostathine is actually present in urine of healthy subjects and in renal stones. Immunocytochemistry of kidney sections localized the protein to cells of the proximal tubules and thick ascending limbs of the Henle's loops. Protein extracts of renal stones inhibited CaCO3 crystal growth in vitro and this inhibition was significantly lifted by incubating the extracts with antibodies to lithostathine. The protein is not immunologically related to nephrocalcin. Because of its structural and functional similarities with pancreatic lithostathine, it was called renal lithostathine.

AB  - Lithostathine is a protein of pancreatic secretion inhibiting calcium carbonate crystal growth. Antibodies to lithostathine were used to identify a related protein in urine and kidney stones. Western blot analysis of proteins extracted from concentrated normal urine or kidney stones demonstrated the presence of a protein with an apparent molecular weight of 23 kDa. The same antibodies were used in immunolocalization experiments on fresh human nephrectomy specimens cryosections. A positive signal was observed in the cells of proximal tubules and thick ascending limbs of Henle's loop. Protein extracts of renal stones inhibited calcium carbonate crystal growth. Because of its structural and functional similarities with pancreatic lithostathine, it was called renal lithostathine.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To present the long-term results of ileum interposition in the ureter for uni- or bilateral ureteral obstruction. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 1981 and 2000, a total of 22 patients received an ileal segment interposition as a substitution for the ureter, of whom 18 were available for analysis. The mean age was 54 years (range 29-73). Patients were followed for a mean period of 65 months (range 2-196). Assessment included clinical examination, serum creatinine levels, renal ultrasonography, intravenous pyelography and isotopic renography. In eight patients, the ileal-ureteral substitution was the first reconstructive procedure. The other patients underwent up to four previous reconstructions of different types. Fourteen patients were treated for unilateral ureteral obstruction, four of whom had a functional or anatomical solitary kidney, the other four patients had bilateral obstruction. RESULTS: In 16 patients renal function improved after ileal-ureteral substitution. One patient underwent a nephrectomy because of a decreased renal function due to an obstruction at the level of the uretero-ileal anastomosis. One patient had a nephrectomy because of recurrent macroscopic hematuria caused by multiple arterio-venous malformations. Overall, 15 patients (83%) had a good functioning kidney after a mean period of 65 months. In three patients an early reintervention was necessary because of bleeding, small bowel obstruction and urinary leakage from a pyelo-ileal anastomosis. Six patients required a reintervention in the long-term: two had a nephrectomy, three had a re-anastomosis between the renal pelvis and the proximal ileal segment, while the sixth patient underwent a PNL for a kidney stone. Recurrent urinary tract infections were seen in six patients, of whom three had to undergo a reintervention. Metabolic acidosis was detected in two patients and was treated with sodium bicarbonate substitution. CONCLUSION: Ileal-ureteral substitution is a valuable procedure with good long-term results and an acceptable rate of secondary interventions in patients for whom other alternatives are not feasible.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The incidence of renal stones in patients on dialysis, while lower in number compared to the general population because of decreased renal function, is nonetheless a clinical dilemma. We wanted to evaluate the incidence and management of stone disease in patients on hemodialysis. METHODS: We reviewed the literature from 1966 to the present using Medline. Study inclusion criteria were detection and treatment of stone disease in both hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis patients. RESULTS: It is estimated that between 5 and 13% of all dialysis patients will develop symptomatic renal calculi and many more asymptomatic calculi. Many of the stone-forming dialysis patients will have recurring stone disease with one study finding an 83.3% recurrence rate. CONCLUSION: Since dialysis patients have a wide range of urine output, the clinician should be alert to the possibility of stone formation. We recommend yearly ultrasound examinations on all dialysis patients as well as citrate and magnesium supplements with careful follow-up of laboratory results and urine electrolytes. We also recommend careful follow-up of all patients on aluminum-hydroxide phosphate binders as they are predisposed to form Al-Mg-urate stones. For those dialysis patients that form renal calculi, watchful waiting and symptomatic treatment is recommended since almost all patients will spontaneously pass their stones. However, ESWL and other current modalities may be used with no greater morbidity compared to nondialysis cohorts. We also suggest that patients with severe recurring intractable stone disease who are candidates for renal transplantation should be offered bilateral nephrectomies.

In total, 2,432 urinary bladders were sampled in the slaughterhouse and checked for abnormal content. Urinary samples were analysed microscopically, and samples of the urinary bladder wall were tested for histological signs of inflammation. The composition of the concrements was examined by infrared spectrophotometry. Macroscopic and microscopic abnormalities were detected in 8.4% and 52.8% of the samples respectively. Magnesium ammonium phosphate (struvite), calcium oxalate dihydrate (COD), calcium carbonate (calcite), calcium oxalate monohydrate (COM) and amorphous crystals were detected. Analysis of stones showed COD in all samples in different proportions. The calcium content of examined stones was always considerable (up to 34%), in contrast to the magnesium content which represented max 1.9%. Struvite was found in one third of the samples, but was never part of stones and grit. COD crystals were the second most common microscopic crystal. These COD crystals and some COD stones had a rectangular shape, and therefore, they can be harmful to the bladder mucosa. In conclusion, uroliths are present in a large proportion of male fattening pigs, and consequently, urinary concrements pose a life-threatening risk for urethra obstruction in male pigs. Further research is warranted to identify potential risk factors for urolithiasis and microscopic crystals.

AB  - This paper describes cases of urolithiasis in fattening pigs on two farms (A and B). Bladder rupture due to urethral obstruction with calculi was the principal finding during the necropsy of the pigs. An in-depth diagnostic examination was performed to elucidate possible pathophysiological mechanisms, namely Fourier-transform infrared spectrophotometry (FT-IR) analysis of the uroliths, blood analysis (farm A: 5 samples, farm B: 10 samples) for assessing concentrations of minerals, the bone resorption marker cross-linked C-telopeptide of type 1 collagen (CTX), parathyroid hormone (PTH), and vitamin D components, biochemical urinalysis (farm A: 5 samples, farm B: 7 samples), microscopic examination of urinary sediment (Farms A and B: 7 samples each), mineral composition of the feed, and analysis of the drinking water. Calcium carbonate was the main component found in stones from both farms, and calcium carbonate and struvite were the main components found in crystals from farms A and B, respectively. On farm A, urinary calcium excretion and urinary pH were high; on farm B, urinary phosphorus was high and urinary calcium was low with a normal urinary pH. The mineral compositions of the feed and drinking water were similar on both farms and could therefore not explain the difference between the two farms. Disturbances in calcium and phosphorus absorption and homeostasis might have been involved in these problems. Further research should focus on the calcium, phosphorus, and vitamin D levels in the feed and take into account other factors, such as the absorption and excretion of minerals due to gut and urinary microbiota.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The Women's Health Initiative (WHI) randomized clinical trial (RCT) of calcium plus vitamin D (CaD) supplements found a 17% excess in urinary tract stone incidence in the supplemented group. This study evaluated whether this risk is modified by participant characteristics. OBJECTIVE: We examined the correlates of urinary tract stone occurrence in the CaD arm of the WHI trial. DESIGN: We analyzed an RCT involving 36,282 postmenopausal women aged 50-79 y from 40 WHI centers: 18,176 women received 500 mg calcium carbonate plus 200 IU vitamin D(3) twice daily (1000 mg and 400 IU daily, respectively), and 18,106 women received a matching placebo for an average of 7.0 y. The incidence of urinary tract stones was determined. RESULTS: The incidence of self-reported clinically diagnosed urinary tract stones was more common in the active CaD medication group than in the placebo group (hazard ratio: 1.17; 95% CI: 1.02, 1.34): 449 women in the CaD group and 381 women in the placebo group reported a stone during the trial. The rates of self-reported stones did not differ between various demographic, anthropomorphic, dietary, and other hypothesized risk factors according to randomization assignment. Neither the total calcium intake nor the use of calcium supplements at baseline was associated with the risk of stones. In sensitivity analyses that censored participants who were below 80% adherence, the findings were similar. CONCLUSIONS: Daily supplementation with CaD for 7 y was associated with an increase in the number of self-reported urinary tract stones. These findings have implications for CaD supplement use. This trial was registered with the WHI at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00000611.

AB  - Four urinary calculi, derived from Chinese swamp buffalo, were studied by using qualitative chemical analysis, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy and qualitative energy dispersive (electron probe) microanalysis. Qualitative chemical analysis showed that the predominant ions were calcium and carbonate with small amounts of magnesium and ammonium. X-ray diffraction confirmed that the calculi were primarily composed of calcium carbonate (calcite). On ultrastructural examination, three apparently distinct structural regions were identified in the calculi: outer large laminations; cavities containing variable numbers of small spheres and rods; and large spheres. There did not appear to be material that acted as a nidus and all regions, on qualitative electron probe analysis, contained primarily calcium with trace amounts of magnesium, phosphorus, potassium and chloride. It was concluded that calcite calculi in Chinese swamp buffalo are probably formed through a process of asynchronous layering and that nidus formation may not be necessary. Moreover, the ultrastructure of the calcite calculi is similar to that reported for siliceous calculi in ruminants and this suggests that similar factors may be involved in their formation.

AB  - There have been few major complications of percutaneous nephrostolithotomy (PNL) reported. We recently experienced cardiac arrest during PNL under epidural anesthesia. The patient was a 52 year old man weighing 64 kg who had been suffering from right renal pelvic stone for years. He was scheduled for PLN under epidural anesthesia. Analgesia was obtained to the level of Th6. The operation proceeded uneventfully for about 60 min. By this time, he suddenly complained nausea, and hypotension with bradycardia occurred. Blood pressure and pulse rate returned immediately to the normal level by IV atropine and ephedrine. But after three minutes, blood pressure and pulse rate went down again. This hypotension with bradycardia was unresponsive to epinephrine, calcium chloride and sodium bicarbonate. This was followed by asystole. Resuscitation was successful with the addition of epinephrine, calcium chloride, and sodium bicarbonate about 15 min after cardiac massage had started. The patient was, on the fifth postoperative day, with no evidence of impairment of renal, cardiac and respiratory functions but a slight impairment of neurologic function. Several possible causes for this cardiac arrest and anesthetic management of percutaneous nephrostolithotomy are discussed.

AB  - Fifteen burned children were noted to have developed renal calculi at our institution over the past 20 years. Primary risk factors appear to be immobilization and a high intake of dairy products and antacids. Presenting symptoms and physical signs include abdominal pain, haematuria, with transient leukocytosis and elevations of the blood urea nitrogen. Conservative therapy with increased fluid administration and urine acidification were successful in 13 of the patients. The remaining two patients required surgical extraction. There were no long-term renal sequelae in any of the patients.

AB  - More than 500 uroliths from dogs, cats, minks, rabbits and 9 further animal species originating from various regions of former East Germany were analysed. The observations were made between 1980 and 1989 using X-ray diffraction and infrared spectroscopy. The urinary stones consisted of struvite, whewellite, weddellite, cystine, ammonium urate, brushite, whitlockite, hydroxyapatite or carbonate-apatite, calcium carbonate, silicon dioxide and organic matrix stones. In dogs, the most frequent types were struvite and apatite concrements, followed by calcium oxalate and cystine uroliths. Among the diseased animals poodles, dachshunds and terriers ranked first. In the analysed material from cats apatite and struvite predominated. With few exceptions, minks formed struvite uroliths only. The analysed calculi from rabbits consisted principally of calcium phosphate or calcium carbonate concrements. The present analysis has been compared with results of former studies, differences are discussed.

AB  - In rats, we recently showed how a chronic metabolic acidosis simultaneously reduced urinary oxalate excretion and promoted oxalate secretion by the distal colon leading to the proposition that acid-base disturbances may trigger changes to renal and intestinal oxalate handling. The present study sought to reproduce and extend these observations using the mouse model, where the availability of targeted gene knockouts (KOs) would offer future opportunities to reveal some of the underlying transporters and mechanisms involved. Mice were provided with a sustained load of acid (NH(4)Cl), base (NaHCO(3)) or the carbonic anhydrase inhibitor acetazolamide (ATZ) for 7 days after which time the impacts on urinary oxalate excretion and its transport by the intestine were evaluated. Mice consuming NH(4)Cl developed a metabolic acidosis but urinary oxalate was only reduced 46% and not statistically different from the control group, while provision of NaHCO(3) provoked a significant 2.6-fold increase in oxalate excretion. For mice receiving ATZ, the rate of urinary oxalate excretion did not change significantly. Critically, none of these treatments altered the fluxes of oxalate (or chloride) across the distal ileum, cecum or distal colon. Hence, we were unable to produce the same effects of a metabolic acidosis in mice that we had previously found in rats, failing to find any evidence of the 'gut-kidney axis' influencing oxalate handling in response to various acid-base challenges. Despite the potential advantages offered by KO mice, this model species is not suitable for exploring how acid-base status regulates oxalate handling between the kidney and intestine.

AB  - Oxalate is a common constituent of kidney stones, but the mechanism of its transport across epithelia is not well understood. With prior research on the role of the intestine focused on mammals, the present study considered oxalate handling by teleost fish. Given the osmotic challenge of seawater (SW), marine teleosts have limited scope for urinary oxalate excretion relative to freshwater (FW) taxa. The marine teleost intestine was hypothesized as the principal route for oxalate elimination, thus demanding epithelial secretion. To test this, intestinal (14)C-oxalate flux was compared between FW- and SW-acclimated sailfin molly (Poecilia latipinna). In SW, oxalate was secreted at remarkable rates (367.90+/-22.95 pmol cm(-2) h(-1)), which were similar following FW transfer (387.59+/-27.82 pmol cm(-2) h(-1)), implying no regulation by salinity. Nevertheless, this ability to secrete oxalate at rates 15-19 times higher than the mammalian small intestine supports this proposal of the teleost gut as a major, previously unrecognized excretory pathway.

AB  - Type of feed is an important consideration in herbivore colony management, yet limited studies report on the effects of diet on common conditions such as urolithiasis in guinea pigs. Urolithiasis is a well-documented cause of lower urinary tract disease in guinea pigs, with calcium carbonate uroliths reported as the predominant calculi formed in the guinea pig urinary tract. A calcium-rich diet has been suggested as a risk factor for of urolithiasis, with numerous commercially available guinea pig diets formulated for adults avoiding ingredients that are higher in calcium. Due to the high incidence of urolithiasis in our strain 13/N guinea pig colony, we conducted a prospective control study following the implementation of dietary changes aimed at improving overall urinary tract health and reducing risk factors for urolithiasis, thus improving colony welfare. A control group was kept on the original ad libitum alfalfa hay-based pellet diet with restricted loose timothy hay (control diet, 14 juveniles and 24 adults). An experimental group was placed on a portioned, 1 oz daily, timothy hay-based pellet diet with ad libitum loose timothy hay (experimental diet, 21 juveniles and 23 adults). Juveniles and adults were followed for a total of 14 and 26 wk, respectively. Longitudinal blood and urine samples were collected to evaluate blood chemistry and urinary parameters, along with weight and body condition scores to assess general health. Overall, dietary changes did not improve parameters associated with improved urinary tract health or reduced risk of urolithiasis; feeding strategy was not found to meaningfully affect calcium crystalluria, urine protein, urine specific gravity, or renal values. These data support alfalfa hay-based pellet or timothy hay-based pellet, when fed with loose timothy hay, as viable options and suggest that practices aimed at reducing dietary calcium by reducing pelleted diet portions are insufficient to mitigate risk factors for urolithiasis in guinea pigs.

AB  - Urinary stones resected from urinary bladders of patients hailing from Kollam district of Kerala State, India were analyzed by SEM, XRD and by thermal analysis techniques. The analytical results indicate that, stones have different composition, i.e., calcium phosphate, calcium phosphate hydroxide and sodium calcium carbonate. Infrared spectral studies also reveal the presence of phosphates or carbonates in these samples. Further, IR spectral investigations have revealed that amorphous carbonated species are occupied in PO(4) sites in calcium phosphate type stone and OH sites in calcium phosphate hydroxide sample. Thermal studies of these samples also reveal that, carbon dioxide is released from carbonated samples upon heating which is related to amount of carbon content and bond strength. Crystals with defects and irregular morphology are grown inside the urinary bladder due to variation in crystal growth conditions.

AB  - Exposure of male weanling Fischer 344 rats to 4.0% terephthalic acid (TPA) in the diet (positive controls) for two weeks (postnatal days 28-42) resulted in a 50% incidence of bladder calculi, aciduria, elevated urinary excretion of calcium (Ca) and magnesium (Mg), and slightly elevated serum levels of Ca and Mg relative to negative controls. Possible mechanisms of TPA-induced urolithiasis were examined by daily oral administration of allopurinol, chlorothiazide, or neutral phosphates, at their recommended therapeutic doses during exposure to dietary 4.0% TPA. An additional group was fed 4.0% TPA and 4.0% sodium bicarbonate in the diet for two weeks. Chlorothiazide or dietary bicarbonate abolished TPA-induced urolithiasis, but allopurinol and neutral phosphates had no effect. Bicarbonate increased water intake above that of positive controls and ameliorated the TPA-induced aciduria. It also increased urinary Mg and TPA above positive control values. Chlorothiazide reduced urinary Ca and TPA levels below those of positive controls. Treatment with chlorothiazide, neutral phosphates or bicarbonate slightly reduced serum Ca below the levels in either positive or negative controls. Drug treatment did not alter TPA-induced elevated serum Mg levels, but bicarbonate reduced serum Mg levels to negative control values. In conclusion, TPA-induced urolithiasis in male weanling rats was abolished by therapeutic agents which reduced urinary Ca and TPA excretion (chlorothiazide), or which enhanced water intake, urinary Mg and TPA excretion, and ameliorated TPA-induced aciduria (dietary bicarbonate). These factors appear to be critical for TPA-induced urolithiasis.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) in pregnancy is rare and unrecognized because the maternal physiological adaptations blurs the symptoms. There is no standard treatment strategy for maternal PHPT. Early diagnosis and interventions can prevent catastrophic consequences to the mother and fetus. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 31-year-old Chinese woman was admitted, due to a lump on the left lower leg for 4 months. The patient complained of mild pain in the left lower leg following exercise that could be relieved after a short rest. The patient was at 18 weeks of gestation, and the growth of the fetus was normal. The patient has a 3-year history of hypercalcemia and a 2-year history of nephrolithiasis. No family history of hypercalcemia and endocrine tumors were present. DIAGNOSIS: Laboratory tests demonstrated high serum calcium level of 3.84 mmol/L, parathyroid hormone 1393 pg/mL, alkaline phosphatase 488 mu/L. Ultrasound showed a 22.4 mm x 7.8 mm solid nodule in the left lower lobe of the thyroid gland. Based on these findings, the patient was diagnosed with PHPT. INTERVENTIONS: The patient accepted continuous renal replacement to reduce ironized calcium level. Parathyroidectomy was performed at the 19th week of gestation. Threatened abortion occurred 2 days after the surgery, and magnesium sulfate was used to prevent the abortion. Calcium gluconate, calcium carbonate and vitamin D3 were used to treat the hypocalcemia that occurred 5 days after the surgery. OUTCOMES: Pathology examination demonstrated the parathyroid adenoma. Abortion was prevented using magnesium sulfate and hypocalcemia was cured with calcium gluconate, calcium carbonate and vitamin D3. At 38-week of gestation, the patient (ionized calcium level: 2.16 mmol/L) delivered a healthy female baby weighing 2700 g with 10/10 Apgar. Till now, both the mother and infant showed no complications. CONCLUSION: Maternal PHPT is rare and challenging to diagnose, causing life-threatening complications to mother and fetus. Any decision regarding surgery for a pregnant woman with primary hyperparathyroidism is more complex than in men or nonpregnant women. The decision should be made based on the severity of hypercalcemia and symptoms.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To compare the efficacy and safety of citrate mixture and sodium bicarbonate on urine alkalization in gout patients under benzbromarone treatment. METHODS: A prospective, randomized, parallel controlled trial was conducted among 200 gout patients in the dedicated gout clinic of the Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University. The participants were randomly divided into two groups (1:1), sodium bicarbonate group (3 g/day) and citrate mixture group (7 g/day). All patients were prescribed with 25 mg/day benzbromarone at initiation and maintained at a dose of 50 mg/day. Clinical and biochemical data were collected at each follow-up time point (baseline, weeks 2, 4, 8 and 12). RESULTS: A total of 182 patients completed the 12-week urine alkalization study. The urine pH value of both groups increased significantly from the baseline to the final follow-up time point (sodium bicarbonate group, 5.50-6.00, P < 0.05; citrate mixture group, 5.53-5.93, P < 0.05). While the comparisons regarding urine pH between treatment groups showed no significant differences for each time point. The estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) dropped significantly after 12 weeks' trial in the sodium bicarbonate group (P < 0.01), while it was comparable between baseline and the last follow-up (P > 0.05) in the citrate mixture group. Results of urine analysis showed that the incident rate of occult blood in the sodium bicarbonate group was higher than that in the citrate mixture group (38 vs 24%, P < 0.05), accompanied by a similar occurrence of kidney stones. After 12-week follow-up, the frequency of twice gout flare in the citrate mixture group was significantly lower than that in sodium bicarbonate group (4 vs 12%, P = 0.037). No treatment-emergent adverse events occurred. CONCLUSION: The efficacy of citrate mixture on urine alkalization is comparable to sodium bicarbonate under benzbromarone treatment without significant adverse events. Citrate mixture is superior to sodium bicarbonate in lowering the incidence of urine occult blood and the frequency of gout attacks.

AB  - PURPOSE: Excessive alkalization will increase the incidence of nephrolithiasis. Sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO(3)) and potassium sodium hydrogen citrate (PSHC) are commonly used drugs for urinary alkalization. We designed a trial to compare PSHC with NaHCO(3) in the urine alkalization for the Chinese healthy participants and to explore the effects of PSHC and NaHCO(3) on circadian rhythms of urine pH value. METHOD: This study was a prospective, crossover, randomized, controlled trial, in which a total of 34 healthy volunteers participated in two study phases and took PSHC and NaHCO(3) at the maintenance dose, respectively. RESULT: The average level of urine pH of PSHC participants in 24 h was significantly higher than that of NaHCO(3) (P < 0.001). The urine pH value of participants taking PSHC and NaHCO(3) or under physiological conditions showed significant variation in 24 h (P < 0.05) and fitted to a mathematical model (Fourier series). Under physiological conditions, the average urine pH value in the daytime was higher than that in the night, and reached the peak at about 10:00, 16:00, and 22:00. The peak of urine pH at 24 h after taking PSHC and NaHCO(3) was both higher than the baseline. The peak time of urine pH and the curve trend were similar, but the peak value in PSHC group was significantly higher than that in NaHCO(3) group. CONCLUSIONS: There was a circadian rhythm of urine pH value under physiological conditions. PSHC was more effective in urinary alkalization than NaHCO(3) at the current maintenance oral dose and administration time without changing the rhythm of urine pH value. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT04352153.

AB  - We report a case of silicate calculi with no history of taking magnesium trisilicate. A 33-year-old woman was sent to our hospital as an emergency case because of severe right lower flank pain. Physical examination was unremarkable except for severe right cost-vertebral angle knock pain. She denied administration of a magnesium trisilicate anti-acid before. She was admitted to the urologic ward since the pain did not relieve in spite of several analgesics. The stone passed spontaneously on the third hospital day. Analysis by infrared spectrophotometry demonstrated the composition to be over 98% of silicate. A review of the literatures discloses only 21 cases of silicate stones.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The predominant mechanism driving hyperuricemia in gout is renal uric acid underexcretion; however, the standard urate-lowering therapy (ULT) recommendation is first-line xanthine oxidase inhibitor (XOI), irrespective of the cause of hyperuricemia. This comparative effectiveness clinical trial was undertaken to compare first-line nontitrated low-dose benzbromarone (LDBen) uricosuric therapy to XOI ULT with low-dose febuxostat (LDFeb) in gout patients with renal uric acid underexcretion. METHODS: We conducted a prospective, randomized, single-center, open-label trial in men with gout and renal uric acid underexcretion (defined as fractional excretion of urate <5.5% and uric acid excretion </=600 mg/day/1.73 m(2) ). A total of 196 participants were randomly assigned to receive LDBen 25 mg daily or LDFeb 20 mg daily for 12 weeks. All participants received daily urine alkalization with oral sodium bicarbonate. The primary end point was the rate of achieving the serum urate target of <6 mg/dl. RESULTS: More participants in the LDBen group achieved the serum urate target than those in the LDFeb group (61% compared to 32%, P < 0.001). Rates of adverse events, including gout flares and urolithiasis, did not differ between groups, with the exception of greater transaminase elevation in the LDFeb group (4% for LDBen compared to 15% for LDFeb, P = 0.008). CONCLUSION: Compared to LDFeb, LDBen has superior urate-lowering efficacy and similar safety in treating relatively young and healthy patients with renal uric acid underexcretion-type gout.

AB  - A 26-year-old female visited our hospital complaining left flank pain and macroscopic hematuria. She had been suffering ulcerative colitis and administered salazosulphapyridine and predonisolone from 17-year-old. Intravenous urography showed radiolucent multiple stones in the left renal pelvis. Three sessions of extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy were performed after ureteral stenting. Although disintegration and discharge of the stones were satisfactory, bladder stone induced by ureteral stent was complicated. The extracted bladder stone showed a yellowish brown color and the surface was granular shape. Composition of the stone was acetyl sulphapyridine which was a metabolite of salazosulphapyridine. After maintenance of the urinary pH ranges between 6.5 and 7.5 by medication of sodium bicarbonate, the patient remains free of stone for 3 years. Drug induced urolithiasis originated from salazosulphapyridine is extremely rare. Satisfactory oral fluid intake and urinary alkalization are important for prevention of sulpha drugs calculi of urinary tract.

AB  - Primary hyperparathyroidism, characterized by hypersecretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH) leading to hypercalcemia and relative hypophosphatemia, is quite common in the elderly. Most patients with primary hyperparathyroidism have only mild hypercalcemia and are symptomless. But others experience various other organ diseases. Primary hyperparathyroidism is also associated with cardiovascular abnormalities, including QT interval shortening, heart block, cardiac arrhythmias, hypertension, myocardial hypertrophy, myocardial calcification and, though rarely, with valvular heart disease. We described a case of primary hyperparathyroidism associated with cardiac abnormalities. An 82-year-old male presented with the complaints of chest discomfort, fatigue, general weakness, nausea and vomiting over a period of months and was admitted in July 1996. Physical examination with heart auscultation showed a pansystolic murmur over the right sternal border and apex region, and a blowing diastolic murmur over the left sternal border. Biochemistry profiles revealed elevations of serum calcium (14.3 mg/dl) and chloride/phosphate ratio (> 33). Endocrinological studies showed elevations of serum PTH-C (4.8 ng/ml) and PTH-intact (705 pg/ml) concentrations. Kidney ultrasonography revealed a left renal stone. A spine X-ray revealed spondylosis and a compression fracture of the lumbar-spine with osteoporotic change. Thyroid ultrasonography and Thallium (Tl201)-technetium (Tc99m) subtraction scan showed parathyroid adenoma in the low pole of the right thyroid bed. Parathyroid aspiration cytology revealed few and discrete cells. Echocardiogram revealed moderate to severe aortic valvular calcification as well as stenosis with moderate aortic regurgitation, mitral regurgitation and myocardial calcification. The patient received parathyroidectomy one month later. During his postoperative days, he suffered from muscle twitching with positive Trousseau's sign and Chvostek's sign. The patient received calcium carbonate and vitamin D for hypocalcemia, diltiazem and capoten for his heart problems. A repeated echocardiogram two months after surgery showed no improvement of valvular calcification.

AB  - PURPOSE: It gives important information in selecting the appropriate treatment for urolithiasis to confirm the component of urinary calculus. Presently component analysis of the urinary calculus is generally performed by infrared spectroscopy which is employed by companies providing laboratory testing services in Japan. The infrared spectroscopy determines the molecular components from the absorption spectra in consequence of atomic vibrations. It has the drawback that an accurate crystal structure cannot be analyzed compared with the X-ray diffraction method which analyzes the crystal constituent based on the diffraction of X-rays on crystal lattice. The components of the urinary calculus including carbonate are carbonate apatite and calcium carbonate such as calcite. Although the latter is reported to be very rare component in human urinary calculus, the results by infrared spectroscopy often show that calcium carbonate is included in calculus. The infrared spectroscopy can confirm the existence of carbonate but cannot determine whether carbonate is originated from carbonate apatite or calcium carbonate. Thus, it is not clear whether calcium carbonate is included in human urinary calculus component in Japan. In this study, we examined human urinary calculus including carbonate by use of X-ray structural analysis in order to elucidate the origin of carbonate in human urinary calculus. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We examined 17 human calculi which were reported to contain calcium carbonate by infrared spectroscopy performed in the clinical laboratory. Fifteen calculi were obtained from urinary tract, and two were from gall bladder. The stones were analyzed by X-ray powder method after crushed finely. RESULTS: The reports from the clinical laboratory showed that all urinary culculi consisted of calcium carbonate and calcium phosphate, while the gallstones consisted of calcium carbonate. But the components of all urinary calculi were revealed to be carbonate apatite by X-ray diffraction. The components of gallstones were shown to be calcium carbonate (one calcite and the other aragonite) not only by infrared spectroscopy but by X-ray diffraction. CONCLUSIONS: It was shown that component analysis of the calculus could be more accurately performed by adding X-ray diffraction method to infrared spectroscopy. It was shown that calcium carbonate existed in a gallstone. As for the carbonate in human urinary calculi, present study showed that it was not calcium carbonate origin but carbonate apatite origin.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Melamine is an industrial chemical used primarily as plastics stabilizer and fire retardant. On September 11, 2008, melamine-contaminated milk products were reported to be responsible for urinary tract calculi in infants and children in China. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence, lesions, risk factors, clinical features, and management of children fed with the melamine-contaminated milk products. METHODS: A total of 15 577 infants and children fed with the milk products were screened at our hospital. Ultrasonography was performed in all the infants and children. For those found with urinary tract calculion ultrasonography, urnalysis was done. Among them, 846 with detailed data screened from September 17 to 25 were enrolled for further analysis in this study. They were divided into calculus group (326 children) and non-calculus group (520 children) according to the results of ultrasonography. They included 429 boys and 417 girls, aged from 1 month to 5 years (median, 18 months). Their clinical and laboratory data, ultrasonograms, and treatment results were analyzed. RESULTS: Of the 15 577 children screened, 562 (3.61%) had urinary tract calculi. The rate was closely related to the melamine concentration in patients fed with formula. In 846 children with detailed data enrolled in this analysis, weight and head circumference Z scores in the calculus group were lower than those in the non-calculus group (P=0.048, P=0.046). Long duration of formula feeding, high melamine contained formula, and minimal water intake were the risk factors for calculi (P<0.05, respectively). Of 326 children with calculi, 281 had small calculiless than 0.5 cm in diameter, 227 had multiple calculi, and 34 had urinary tract distention. Moreover, diffuse renal lesions, renal failure and ascites were noted in 4, 3 and 2 patients, respectively. After 1-month treatment with sodium bicarbonate and Chinese traditional medicine, calculi disappeared in 49 of 54 outpatients. In 41 inpatients, 5 had calculi removed operatively and 36 had calculi minimized. CONCLUSIONS: Melamine-contaminated milk products induced urinary tract calculi, which have a good response to conservative therapy. Long-term follow-up of infants and children fed with melamine-contaminated milk products is required, and food safety should be supervised increasingly for the health of children.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Kidney stone disease is a common surgical disease and a significant public health issue, which may be influenced by environmental factors such as domestic water hardness and its related minerals. Previous studies have shown inconsistent and controversial results regarding the impact of domestic water hardness on kidney stone formation. METHODS: This prospective cohort study analyzed data from 288 041 participants in the UK Biobank with no prior history of kidney stones from 2006 to 2024. The exposures were domestic water hardness, calcium concentration, calcium carbonate concentration, and magnesium concentration. The main outcomes were the disease status and onset time of kidney stone diseases. The confounding factors of model adjustment included age, sex, ethnicity, economic level, education level, Townsend Deprivation Index, Index of Multiple Deprivation, assessment center, body mass index, drug history influencing the metabolism of calcium and magnesium, and water intake based on the directed acyclic graph of causal hypothesis. The association between domestic water hardness and kidney stones was assessed using the Cox regression models, sensitivity analyses, subgroup and interactive analyses. RESULTS: During the follow-up period, 3298 participants (1.14%) developed kidney stones. In all participants, the mean concentration of calcium, calcium carbonate, and magnesium was 52.61, 135.01, and 4.66 mg/L, respectively. In Cox regression models, higher magnesium levels (Q4, > 5 mg/L) in natural water use can reduce the risk of kidney stones [HR and 95% CI: 0.88 (0.80-0.97) in model 3], but no significant correlation was found in domestic water hardness, calcium concentration, and calcium carbonate concentration in the overall models. Four sensitivity analyses further supported the overall results in the overall models. In subgroup analysis, hard water and calcium concentration in domestic water can increase the 18%-34% incidence risk of kidney stones in participants over 60 years old and female participants; high magnesium concentration (>5 mg/L) in domestic water can decrease the 10%-28% risk of kidney stones in males, participants </= 45 years old, and participants without renal failure. Magnesium interacted with other minerals, and its protective effects were more significant in hard water (HR: 0.73, 95% CI: 0.61-0.87), a high concentration of CaCO 3 (HR: 0.62, 95% CI: 0.50-0.78), and calcium (HR: 0.48, 95% CI: 0.33-0.71) in domestic water. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggested that magnesium levels in water can decrease kidney stone risk, but in the overall population, domestic water hardness, calcium concentration, and calcium carbonate concentration have no significant impact on the formation of kidney stones. Interestingly, hard water and its calcium concentration can promote the formation risk of kidney stones in participants > 60 years old and females, while high magnesium concentration in domestic water can reduce the risk in males, </= 45 years old, and those without renal failure. The protective effects of magnesium interacted with other minerals and were more obvious in the population intake of hard water and high concentrations of CaCO 3 and calcium. This study contributes to the complex understanding of environmental factors in kidney stone etiology and suggests a need for focusing on mineral-specific effects in different populations and interaction with other minerals, which hope to provide some evidence of water's role in public health and clinical management of kidney stones.

AB  - Aims/Background Hyperuricemia is a metabolic disorder characterized by elevated levels of uric acid in the blood. If left untreated, hyperuricemia can progress to gout, which manifests as acute arthritic attacks, and may also lead to uric acid nephrolithiasis and other renal conditions. This widespread condition poses significant risks to human health and quality of life. This study retrospectively evaluated the effectiveness and safety of using benzbromarone in combination with sodium bicarbonate tablets for the treatment of gout associated with hyperuricemia. Methods The study reviewed the electronic medical records (EMR) of 150 patients with gout and hyperuricemia who were admitted to our hospital between May 2018 and December 2023. These patients were divided into two groups: a control group and a research group. The control group received oral sodium bicarbonate tablets, while the research group was treated with oral benzbromarone tablets in addition to sodium bicarbonate tablets. The study compared the treatment outcomes and adverse reactions between the two groups, as well as assessed changes in blood-related indicators, the number of tophi, pain levels, and quality of life before and after treatment. Results The research group demonstrated a higher total effective rate compared to the control group (p < 0.05). Post-treatment, the research group exhibited significantly lower levels of serum uric acid (UA), serum creatinine (Scr), and urea (p < 0.05). Additionally, this group had fewer tophi and lower visual analog scale (VAS) scores compared to the control group (p < 0.05). Quality of life scores were also significantly higher in the research group (p < 0.05). No statistically significant difference was found in the incidence of adverse drug reactions between the two groups (p > 0.05). Conclusion The combination of benzbromarone and sodium bicarbonate tablets is highly effective in treating gout associated with hyperuricemia. This treatment not only reduces uric acid levels and the number of tophi but also enhances renal function, alleviates pain, and improves the overall quality of life for patients.
