AB  - Background: Nephrocalcinosis, characterized by excessive calcium deposition within the renal parenchyma, can be a long-term complication of anorexia nervosa (AN). The extent of renal calcification can range from molecular-level alterations to macroscopic stone formation, contributing to progressive kidney injury. While early detection is critical for prognosis, limited studies have characterized the structural and elemental composition of renal calcifications associated with AN. Here, we report a case of nephrocalcinosis in the setting of AN. Case presentation: A 25-year-old woman with AN presented with progressive renal dysfunction and gouty arthritis. Renal biopsy revealed focal tubulointerstitial nephritis with extensive calcification. Conventional light microscopy identified crystalline deposits within the tubular lumen, but further characterization required advanced imaging techniques. Low-vacuum scanning electron microscopy (LV-SEM) of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) specimens demonstrated more widespread crystalline deposits than were visible by routine histopathology. Elemental analysis via energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDX) confirmed that the deposits were primarily composed of calcium phosphate. Conclusions: These findings underscore the utility of LV-SEM/EDX in detecting and characterizing renal calcifications at high resolution. The ability to perform elemental analysis on FFPE tissue sections provides a novel and practical approach for elucidating the pathogenesis of nephrocalcinosis. These methods may enhance the accuracy of renal crystal identification, thereby facilitating earlier diagnosis and improved management of nephrocalcinosis. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Urinary stone size is key in determining treatment. Although computed tomography (CT) scans are widely used for diagnosing urinary stones, measurements of stone size obtained from CT images may be inaccurate compared to actual size. Twenty-four urinary stone phantoms were 3D printed at three densities (100, 1000, and 3000 Hounsfield units [HU]) and eight sizes. CT images of the phantoms were taken. Nineteen radiologists and 33 emergency physicians from two institutions measured stone sizes on CT images using mediastinum and bone settings. An automated algorithm segmented regions of interest and estimated stone size using pixel HUs. Mean absolute error (MAE) was assessed for the accuracy of each measurement method against known phantom sizes. For the mediastinum setting, MAEs for 100, 1000, and 3000 HU stone phantoms were 1.05 mm ± 0.06, 1.01 mm ± 0.06, and 2.38 mm ± 0.17, respectively. For the bone setting, MAEs were 0.98 mm ± 0.07, 0.55 mm ± 0.10, and 1.91 mm ± 0.06, respectively. For automated measurements, MAEs were 1.16 mm, 0.21 mm, and 2.10 mm, respectively. Participant-to-participant variability was observed across all measurement settings, regardless of the stone density or window used. For stone size measurements on CT images, the bone setting provided more accurate results than the mediastinum setting. Automated measurement methods, which estimate stone size by outlining its edges, were more accurate than manual measurements for 1000 HU stones, the most common stone density. However, for stones with densities above or below 1000 HU, the accuracy of the automated method may decrease. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Background and objective: Standardized protocols for optimal ureteral access sheath (UAS) positioning during flexible ureterorenoscopy (f-URS) lithotripsy have yet to be established. This study utilizes computational fluid dynamics (CFD) techniques to analyze the impact of varying UAS positions on stone clearance rates, aiming to identify the optimal UAS position for enhanced stone fragment evacuation. Materials and methods: Various f-URS models were created using ANSYS SpaceClaim software. These models were then imported into ANSYS Fluent for meshing and computational simulation. The study evaluated the impact on stone clearance rates as the UAS was incrementally advanced towards the distal end of the f-URS, also observing the effects on local irrigation flow velocity at different UAS positions. Results: Three models were constructed to simulate stone positions within the renal pelvis, lower calyx, and middle calyx. Each model generated 80 stone particles. In the middle calyx model, the numbers of particles evacuated were 32, 53, 58, and 67 for UAS positions A, B, C, and D, respectively. In the lower calyx model, particle clearance was 15, 21, 37, and 46 for UAS positions A, B, C, and D, respectively. In the renal pelvis model, particle evacuation was 14, 18, 31, and 61 for UAS positions A, B, C, and D, respectively. Position D represents the alignment of the UAS tip flush with the f-URS tip. Stones were deposited in the lower calyx by gravity. Contour plots and vector displays showed the highest irrigation velocity in the UAS and f-URS channels, with a relative low-flow region between the UAS and f-URS tips. When the UAS and f-URS tips were aligned, this low-flow region substantially disappeared. Conclusions: Ureteral access sheath positioning significantly correlates with stone clearance rates. Maximal stone particle evacuation occurred when the distal tips of the UAS and f-URS were aligned. Variations in UAS position resulted in changes in local irrigation velocity. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Primary hyperparathyroidism can be divided into three clinical phenotypes: classical primary hyperparathyroidism with hypercalcemia and target organ involvement, asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism with hypercalcemia, and normocalcemic primary hyperparathyroidism. The latter phenotype is being increasingly recognized in patients having serum parathyroid hormone levels measured as part of the initial evaluation of osteoporosis. The diagnosis of normocalcemic primary hyperparathyroidism requires exclusion of secondary causes of parathyroid hormone elevation, such an vitamin D deficiency and calcium malabsorption. There is no consensus on the management of patients with normocalcemic primary hyperparathyroidism, particularly with regard to consideration of parathyroid surgery versus clinical observation. This is a case report of a patient with persistently normal calcium levels, high parathyroid hormone, and no recognized cause of secondary hyperparathyroidism. This case was presented and discussed at Bone Health Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes, a virtual community of practice that has been meeting online weekly since 2015. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Background and Objective: Urinary pH is an important factor in the preventative management of kidney stones. A variety of options are available for modulating urinary pH, including pharmaceuticals, over the counter (OTC) formulations [such as stone specific OTCs, complementary and alternative medicines (CAMs), and home remedies], and dietary modifications. These options can be overwhelming for both providers and patients and vary with regards to cost, convenience, and efficacy. In the absence of a consolidated central source of information for patients and physicians to reference, our study aims to summarize and analyze the effectiveness of these various treatment approaches to provide a more comprehensive understanding of how common interventions alter urinary pH. Methods: The PubMed database was used to identify human clinical trials related to pharmacologic and dietary interventions to modify urinary pH. Eligible studies were selected based on the following criteria: (I) observational or interventional study; (II) urinary pH as a reported outcome of the study intervention; (III) inclusion baseline or control urinary pH data; (IV) sufficient presentation of data for analytical purposes. Data was abstracted, and the mean changes in urinary pH for each intervention were compiled and grouped. Key Content and Findings: A total of 86 studies met inclusion criteria: 61 were randomized clinical trials, 20 were crossover or prospective studies, and 5 were observational cohort reports. In total, 150 individual experiments with a combined sample size of 2,895 were included. For urinary alkalinization, the most effective pharmaceutical, OTC formulation, and dietary change were sodium bicarbonate, Citro-Soda®, and lacto-ovo-vegetarian diet, respectively. For urinary acidification, the most effective interventions were ammonium chloride, methionine, and high protein diet, respectively. Conclusions: Our study found that pharmaceuticals are not the only effective options for altering urine pH; select dietary changes and OTC options are also viable for patients. When considering cost, accessibility and side effects, these alternative options may be more appealing to some patients, potentially improving adherence compared to pharmaceuticals. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Background/Objectives: Patients with chronic hypoparathyroidism are at increased risk of kidney complications. Also, chronic kidney disease is associated with increased cardiovascular risk. The aim was to analyze the factors that influence kidney function, including cardiovascular diseases (CVD), in a cohort of patients with chronic hypoparathyroidism. Methods: This was a retrospective longitudinal study that included 100 patients with chronic hypoparathyroidism. Results: The estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was associated with the duration of disease (p = 0.014). During follow-up, a significant decrease in eGFR was observed over time (p < 0.001), and changes in the eGFR were associated with the duration of disease (p < 0.001). We found that the eGFR was lower in patients with urolithiasis (p = 0.003), hypertension (p < 0.001), type 2 diabetes (p = 0.031) and dyslipidemia (p < 0.001). In total, 14% of patients had a chronic kidney disease (CKD), and these patients had a longer duration of disease (p < 0.001). The percentage of patients with urolithiasis (p = 0.003), nephrocalcinosis (p = 0.008), hypertension (p = 0.005), type 2 diabetes (p < 0.001), dyslipidemia (p < 0.001), coronary heart disease (p = 0.008), and arrhythmia (p < 0.001) was higher in patients with CKD. Logistic regression models showed that disease duration was associated with CKD (OR = 1.11; 95% CI [1.03–1.22]; p = 0.008). We used ROC curves to assess the usefulness of disease duration as a marker of CKD, and the AUC was 0.850 (95% CI 0.763–0.937, p < 0.001). A duration of disease > 15.5 years had a sensitivity of 85.7% and a specificity of 71.9% for a diagnosis of CKD. Conclusions: The duration of disease appears to be a predictor of the presence of renal dysfunction in patients with chronic hypoparathyroidism. In addition, the coexistence of CVD factors could result in greater renal damage. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Urolithiasis, a condition characterized by the formation of urinary calculi (stones), is one of the most common conditions affecting ruminants. This chapter provides a comprehensive overview of the treatment options for urolithiasis. Urolithiasis can lead to various pathologic conditions such as complete urethral obstruction, bladder rupture, and painful urethral inflammation. The chapter discusses the common locations of obstructive urolithiasis in small ruminants and the chemical composition of different types of calculi, including struvite and calcium carbonate stones. Treatment strategies are tailored based on the type of stone and the purpose of the animal, ranging from medical management with urinary acidification techniques to various surgical interventions such as urethral process amputation, urethrostomy, and tube cystostomy. The chapter also addresses the management of complications like hyperkalemia and provides detailed surgical techniques and postoperative care guidelines. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Urine retention is a prevalent and economically significant condition among male calves, particularly in developing countries where ruminants serve critical agricultural and socio-economic roles. This study aimed to clinically, surgically, biochemically, and economically assess obstructive urolithiasis in male calves, evaluating the efficacy and feasibility of various surgical interventions. Seventeen male calves aged 1–12 months and six apparently healthy calves were categorized into three groups: healthy controls (n=6), calves with intact distended bladders (n=5), and those with ruptured bladders (n=12). Clinical examinations and biochemical profiling were conducted preoperatively. Surgical interventions included pre-scrotal urethrostomy for intact bladders and cystoplasty with dorsal urethrotomy for ruptured bladders. Results indicated that bladder rupture was associated with younger age, lower body weight, and delayed urine retention. The sigmoid flexure was the predominant site of obstruction, with clinical signs varying by bladder status. Seasonal patterns indicated a spring peak in incidence, linked to nutritional and hydration shifts. Biochemically, ruptured cases exhibited marked elevations in urea, creatinine, uric acid, potassium, phosphorus, and magnesium levels, reflecting systemic derangement. Postoperative complications were minimal but more frequent in ruptured cases. The majority of the stones were calcium carbonate and phosphate. Stone size and volume positively correlated with calf body weight, suggesting dietary and metabolic influences. Surgical resolution, combined with targeted medical therapy, proved effective in restoring urinary function and preventing recurrence or mortality. The study underscores the importance of early diagnosis, surgical intervention, and preventive strategies such as dietary adjustments and urine acidification to mitigate recurrence and avoid economic losses. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Objective To determine the urolith trace elemental profile and the association of these elements with urolith type and animal variables. Methods This was a cross-sectional study of 165 goat and 50 pig uroliths collected from urinary bladders from January 1, 1982, through December 31, 2020. Urolith mineral composition was determined using polarized light microscopy and infrared spectroscopy. Trace element analysis was determined by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry. The association between animal variables and trace element content was assessed. The strength of grouping effects of the elements within the uroliths was determined by cluster analysis. Results Calcium carbonate (74 of 116 [63%]) and apatite (22 of 47 [47%]) were the most commonly identified urolith types in goats and pigs, respectively. The element with the highest concentrations in calcium carbonate uroliths in goats was calcium. Apatite-containing uroliths from pigs had phosphorous as the highest concentration element. Large goat breeds (OR, 1.2; 95% CI, 1.1 to 1.4) and non–pot-bellied pigs had higher odds (OR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.2 to 2.0) of detection of trace elements. The combination of barium, calcium, sodium, and strontium in goats defined the most significant dissimilarity (divergence) within the calcium carbonate uroliths. In pigs, boron, potassium, sodium, and strontium combination defined the most significant dissimilarity within the apatite uroliths. Conclusions Trace elements in combinations that defined significant dissimilarity among uroliths suggest an association between trace elements and urolith type. Clinical Relevance Trace and macroelements should be analyzed in uroliths and feed to optimize dietary recommendations for uroli-thiasis prevention. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The article discusses the results of the study of the mineral composition of urinary stones obtained as a result of self-expulsion, as well as the use of minimally invasive surgical techniques in 124 patients with urolithiasis. There was a mixed composition of the stone in most patients-106 (74.2%), consisting of two or more mineral components. Depending on the predominant component, the volume fraction of which was more than 50% of the sample, urinary stones were classified into 3 mineral types: type 1-oxalate-calcium concrements, the dominant component of which is calcium oxalate in the form of monohydrate (vevelite) or dihydrate (vedelite); type 2-phosphate-calcium, in which more than 50% of the volume is represented by apatite, hydroxylapatite or fluorapatite; type 3-stones, the dominant substance of which is uric acid or uric acid dihydrate. Most urinary stone samples were represented by concrements of type 1, which was significantly more common in male patients. No gender dependence in the prevalence of stones of types 2 and 3 was found. Type 1 urinary stones were observed in all age categories, with a predominance in patients aged 30-39 years (41.38%). The age distribution of type 2 stones had similar characteristics, with the maximum number of patients with this type of stone being in the age range of 40-49 years (33.3%), with a further decrease in this indicator in older age groups. The minimum number of cases of type 3 stone formation was registered among patients aged 30-39 years (5.88%). In the following age periods, the quantitative presence of this type of stone increased with a maximum value in the age range of 50-59 years (52.94%). © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Mountain tapirs (Tapirus pinchaque) are endangered land mammals and there are few descriptions of urinary diseases that affect them. This report describes a 17-year-old mountain tapir presenting with hyporexia and chronic weight loss caused by unilateral nephrolithiasis and hydronephrosis. Unilateral nephrectomy returned this mountain tapir to normal weight with resolution of clinical signs. Characteristics of the smooth circular uroliths found in this mountain tapir were consistent with the rarer type II variant found in horses and was composed of 100% calcium carbonate. Type II uroliths in horses typically have amorphous shapes and include phosphate. This case showed that mountain tapirs are susceptible to nephrolithiasis, which may progress to hydronephrosis, and that unilateral nephrectomy is a feasible treatment. Despite the success of nephrectomy in this case, further investigation is required in captive mountain tapirs to more clearly understand management of nephrolithiasis and how it equates with what is known in horses. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Airway management during the perioperative period is a vital component of perioperative care. However, there is a lack of consensus on the selection of medications, timing of administration, and the management of airway complications. This consensus aimed to promote a more rational and standardized application of airway management medications. Methods: Clinical medical and pharmaceutical experts were invited to participate in this study using the modified Delphi method. Participants completed two rounds of online surveys, with the second round based on the responses from the first round. Results: Participants (n = 42) reached a consensus on 11 clinical issues and formed 11 recommendations for clinical practice, each with a consensus degree of more than 80%. The recommendations covered aspects of preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative risk factors evaluation, along with crucial points of medication monitoring in preventing and treating perioperative pulmonary complications. Conclusions: The modified Delphi method resulted in consensus recommendations for the perioperative physician–pharmacist airway co-management. We hope this consensus will prevent pulmonary complications and improve patient outcomes through collaborative discussions between physicians and pharmacists. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Importance: Despite receiving postacute rehabilitation services, many older women with a recent hip fracture repair are unable to return to their prefracture level of function. Whether testosterone therapy can enhance recovery after hip fracture in older women with persistent mobility impairments has not been fully examined. Objective: To evaluate the effects of a supervised exercise program combined with topical testosterone therapy on functional outcomes in older women with a recent hip fracture. Design, Setting, and Participants: This phase 3 double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial, Starting a Testosterone and Exercise Program After Hip Injury (STEP-HI), was conducted at 8 US sites between December 2018 and August 2023. Participants were women aged 65 years or older with a recent surgical repair of a nonpathologic femur fracture, met objective criteria for mobility impairment, and were community dwelling after discharge from rehabilitation. During the first 14 months of the trial, participants were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 treatment groups: exercise plus topical testosterone gel, exercise plus placebo gel, or enhanced usual care. Statistical analysis, using a modified intention-to-treat approach, was performed from November 2023 to November 2024. Interventions: For 24 weeks, the 2 exercise groups underwent a supervised, multimodal high-intensity exercise program that included progressive resistance training with trained and certified exercise interventionists. Testosterone was provided in the form of a topical gel (generic 1.0% testosterone), and the placebo gel was chemically identical but without testosterone. The enhanced usual care group was prescribed a self-administered low-intensity home-based exercise program and a staff-led monthly health education session. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was the between-group difference in the change in the 6-minute walking distance (6MWD) from baseline to 24 weeks. Results: Among the 129 women randomized (54 to the exercise plus testosterone group, 55 to the exercise plus placebo group, and 20 to the enhanced usual care group; mean [SD] age, 79.3 [8.4] years) included in the STEP-HI trial (122 (94.6%) provided primary outcome data for baseline and at least 1 time point (12 or 24 weeks). The mean (SD) change in the 6MWD between baseline and 24 weeks was not significantly different for exercise plus topical testosterone gel (n = 53; 42.7 [8.2] m) compared with exercise plus placebo gel (n = 51; 40.5 [8.4] m) and enhanced usual care (n = 18; 37.7 [14.8] m). Conclusions and Relevance: In the STEP-HI randomized clinical trial, supervised exercise training combined with testosterone therapy conducted in older women recovering from a hip fracture did not lead to significant improvement in 6MWD compared with supervised exercise alone. Adding testosterone therapy to exercise may not provide further benefits for long-distance mobility. Whether it can improve physical performance and mobility for short distances in this patient population warrants further study. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - This report describes cardiovascular and renal soft tissue mineralization and renal intratubular crystals in 13 out of 16 guinea pigs that were given very hard drinking water for 9 months. These animals, aged 14 to 20 months, were experimentally naïve. No clinical symptoms were observed, but 1 guinea pig was found dead in its cage. Necropsy did not reveal any gross findings; however, histologic examination revealed mineralization and crystal formations. Despite no known changes in the feed sourcing or formulation, the possibility that the incident was feed-related was considered. The most recent analysis of the feed obtained from the manufacturer during this period, which was conducted by an accredited laboratory authorized by the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, was appropriate. No similar lesions were reported at other centers using the same feed; however, drinking water analysis for total dissolved solids revealed extremely hard water, with elevated levels of calcium and calcium carbonate and low magnesium levels, due to a malfunctioning water treatment system. After installing a new system to balance calcium and magnesium, no new cases appeared over the next 2 years. It was determined that the mineralization and crystal formations were most likely caused by water hardness. This study demonstrates that mineralization typically attributed to feed in guinea pigs can also result from high calcium content in drinking water, highlighting the importance of water analysis in such cases. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Soil degradation due to sodicity is a major constraint to agricultural development in arid and semi-arid regions. The accumulation of exchangeable Na+ ions affects soil physicochemical properties, which subsequently increases pH, thus reducing crop yield and nutrient availability. Several practices have been followed for revitalizing salt-affected soils, such as the addition of inorganic or organic amendments. Since most of these soils are calcareous (CaCO<inf>3</inf>) in nature, they can serve as a cationic source to release Ca2+ to replace the Na+ from the clay-complex. Though CaCO<inf>3</inf> is poorly soluble, dissolution can be easily achieved by calcite dissolving bacteria. The present study aimed to evaluate the efficiency of Brevibacterium sp. SOTI06, in reclaiming calcareous sodic soil, along with organic and inorganic inputs through a soil incubation study. The reduction in pH, Na+, ESP (Exchangeable sodium percent), and free CaCO<inf>3</inf> during the incubation period confirms the efficiency of amendments. The pH was drastically reduced from 9.10 to 8.20 in gypsum-applied soils. The combined effect of bacterium and press mud reduced higher rates of CaCO<inf>3</inf> in soil (16.6 to 14.5%), with a rise of Ca2+ ions (23.5 to 28.7 meq 100 g soil–1). The mean calcite dissolution was higher in bioinoculant and gypsum-applied soils (9.04%). The SEM (Scanning Electron Microscopy) images confirmed the colonization and calcite dissolution potential of Brevibacterium sp. SOTI06 by pit formation in calcite stones. Hence, this study revealed that the combined application of bioinoculants with organic and inorganic amendments can effectively reclaim calcareous sodic soils. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Objective: Several therapeutic modalities for the prevention of calcium oxalate (CaOx) stones have been studied, but only a select few of these modalities have been incorporated into the American Urological Association guidelines. Our study aimed to organize and interrogate existing research that may be promising for CaOx prevention. Methods: A literature search was conducted using MEDLINE and Embase from inception to November 16, 2022. Our study population included adults with or without a history of CaOx kidney stones. Studies in which patients were treated with pharmacotherapies, herbal supplements, or uncategorized research chemicals that are not included in the current American Urological Association guidelines for preventing CaOx stones were included. Nonoriginal research was excluded. Results: Out of the 6155 identified articles, 38 were included in the final analysis. The five distinct categories of interventions for stone prevention were “medications”, “herbal supplements”, “food and macronutrients”, “micronutrients”, and “enzymes and probiotics”. Modalities that were found to reduce known urinary risk factors were tolvaptan, cranberry juice, magnesium citrate, oxalate-degrading enzyme ALLN-177, and malic acid. Prophylaxis that reduced stone formation were sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors, eicosapentaenoic acid, ethane-1-hydroxy-1,1-disphosphonate. Therapies that reduced urinary risk factors and stone formation were Phyllanthus niruri, rice bran, and magnesium hydroxide. Conclusion: Several of the identified therapies may provide prophylactic benefits for CaOx stone formation and may be useful for inclusion in guidelines for kidney stone prevention. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Aims: A 42-year-old male developed chronic primary hypoparathyroidism after total thyroidectomy. Conventional therapy led to recurrent nephrolithiasis and therefore rhPTH(1-84) (parathyroid hormone [PTH]) treatment was considered. According to the dosing guideline for PTH, calcium plasma levels are adequately controlled with once-daily administration. However, the effect on urinary calcium excretion is only transient and hence does not lower the risk of nephrolithiasis. This raises the question of whether multiple-daily or continuous administration of PTH is more effective in lowering urinary calcium excretion. We aimed to construct a pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PKPD) model to answer this question. Methods: A single patient was treated with intermittent PTH followed by off-label continuous infusion of PTH. PTH was measured in plasma, calcium and phosphate in plasma and urine. A one-compartment PKPD model for PTH was developed with Edsim++. The effect of PTH was described by the relative clearance of calcium and phosphate. Results: The PKPD model for PTH showed visually a marked effect on phosphate clearance, but less on calcium clearance. During the study, the patient also received medication that influenced calcium homeostasis but to a lesser extent phosphate homeostasis. Therefore, phosphate was chosen as the effect parameter, resulting in an EC50 of 6.3 pmol/L PTH. Conclusions: The PKPD model for PTH was completed with the unique data of a single patient who received PTH according to various dosing regimens, including continuous infusion. Continuous administration of PTH is favoured because it permanently increases the phosphate clearance and therefore needs to be further investigated. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Objectives This cross-sectional study aims to evaluate the association between calcium and vitamin D supplementation for osteoporosis treatment and the development of kidney stones while investigating the impact of urinary calcium excretion on kidney stone risk among patients receiving this supplementation treatment. Design The study involved collecting data from 204 Chinese Han patients aged 50-89 with osteoporosis in the southwest region of China. These patients had been on daily doses of 600 mg of calcium carbonate and 0.5 μg alfacalcidol for at least 1 year. The study employed univariate analysis and multivariable logistic regression to identify risk factors for kidney stones, with independent t-tests used to compare differences between groups. Setting Data were collected from patients in the southwest region of China, covering the period from July 2019 to December 2023. Participants The study included 204 patients with osteoporosis, all of whom had been receiving the specified calcium and vitamin D supplements for the duration of the study. Results The study found that a history of recurrent kidney stones was an independent risk factor for the development of kidney stones. Patients with kidney stones who had a history of recurrent stones exhibited significantly higher levels of 24-hour urinary calcium excretion (1.00±0.62 vs 0.57±0.54, p=0.026) compared with those without such a history. Conclusions The results suggest that a history of recurrent kidney stones independently increases the risk of kidney stones in patients undergoing calcium and vitamin D supplementation for osteoporosis, likely due to increased urinary calcium excretion. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Zinc (Zn) is an essential element for all living organisms, and Zn isotopes play a key role in studying the formation of disease. Despite extensive studies on Zn isotopes in healthy and diseased human tissues, the role of Zn isotopes in urinary stones remains unexplored. This study investigates Zn isotopes in 37 urinary stones using multi-collector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. The δ66Zn values of urinary stones range from −0.15‰ to 0.47‰, with a mean value of 0.11‰. Carbonate apatite (CA) stones exhibit lighter Zn isotopic compositions (δ66Zn = −0.15‰ ∼ −0.03‰) compared to calcium oxalate (CO) stones (δ66Zn = −0.11‰ ∼ 0.47‰). The variation in Zn isotopic compositions between CO and CA stones may result from urinary pH differences during stone formation. At higher urinary pH, CA stones are enriched in lighter Zn isotopes compared to CO stones. Urinary stones are enriched in lighter Zn isotopes compared to blood and urine. This study identifies two steps influencing Zn isotope variations during kidney transport. The first step involves kidney filtration and reabsorption, enriching heavy Zn isotope in the urine. The second step is the deposition process of urinary stones, where light isotopes, due to their lower bond energy, are more prone to breaking. This kinetic fractionation effect leads to an enrichment of light Zn isotope in urinary stones. Overall, this study offers preliminary insights into the geochemical mechanisms that influence the Zn isotopic composition in urinary stones. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Kidney stone disease is a common surgical disease and a significant public health issue, which may be influenced by environmental factors such as domestic water hardness and its related minerals. Previous studies have shown inconsistent and controversial results regarding the impact of domestic water hardness on kidney stone formation. METHODS: This prospective cohort study analyzed data from 288 041 participants in the UK Biobank with no prior history of kidney stones from 2006 to 2024. The exposures were domestic water hardness, calcium concentration, calcium carbonate concentration, and magnesium concentration. The main outcomes were the disease status and onset time of kidney stone diseases. The confounding factors of model adjustment included age, sex, ethnicity, economic level, education level, Townsend Deprivation Index, Index of Multiple Deprivation, assessment center, body mass index, drug history influencing the metabolism of calcium and magnesium, and water intake based on the directed acyclic graph of causal hypothesis. The association between domestic water hardness and kidney stones was assessed using the Cox regression models, sensitivity analyses, subgroup and interactive analyses. RESULTS: During the follow-up period, 3298 participants (1.14%) developed kidney stones. In all participants, the mean concentration of calcium, calcium carbonate, and magnesium was 52.61, 135.01, and 4.66 mg/L, respectively. In Cox regression models, higher magnesium levels (Q4, > 5 mg/L) in natural water use can reduce the risk of kidney stones [HR and 95% CI: 0.88 (0.80-0.97) in model 3], but no significant correlation was found in domestic water hardness, calcium concentration, and calcium carbonate concentration in the overall models. Four sensitivity analyses further supported the overall results in the overall models. In subgroup analysis, hard water and calcium concentration in domestic water can increase the 18%-34% incidence risk of kidney stones in participants over 60 years old and female participants; high magnesium concentration (>5 mg/L) in domestic water can decrease the 10%-28% risk of kidney stones in males, participants ≤ 45 years old, and participants without renal failure. Magnesium interacted with other minerals, and its protective effects were more significant in hard water (HR: 0.73, 95% CI: 0.61-0.87), a high concentration of CaCO 3 (HR: 0.62, 95% CI: 0.50-0.78), and calcium (HR: 0.48, 95% CI: 0.33-0.71) in domestic water. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggested that magnesium levels in water can decrease kidney stone risk, but in the overall population, domestic water hardness, calcium concentration, and calcium carbonate concentration have no significant impact on the formation of kidney stones. Interestingly, hard water and its calcium concentration can promote the formation risk of kidney stones in participants > 60 years old and females, while high magnesium concentration in domestic water can reduce the risk in males, ≤ 45 years old, and those without renal failure. The protective effects of magnesium interacted with other minerals and were more obvious in the population intake of hard water and high concentrations of CaCO 3 and calcium. This study contributes to the complex understanding of environmental factors in kidney stone etiology and suggests a need for focusing on mineral-specific effects in different populations and interaction with other minerals, which hope to provide some evidence of water's role in public health and clinical management of kidney stones.

AB  - Purpose: This retrospective case-control study from 2008 to 2022 aimed to determine the effect of adjunctive sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO<inf>3</inf>) on treatment outcomes of and side effects of acetazolamide (ACZ) for the treatment of idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH). Subjects/Methods: Retrospective data was collected via chart review. 288 eyes of 144 patients with IIH, including those taking ACZ alone (control group, n = 89) vs. ACZ and NaHCO<inf>3</inf> (treatment group, n = 56). The primary outcome measure was time to IIH resolution. Secondary outcomes included retinal nerve fibre layer thickness (RNFL), visual field mean deviation (VFMD), visual acuity (VA), discontinuation ACZ, and patient-reported side effects of ACZ. Results: Cox proportional hazards model for the primary outcome yielded a hazard ratio of 0.800, which was statistically insignificant (95% CI, 0.57–1.13; p = 0.200). There was no significant difference between groups when comparing RNFL, VFMD, VA, surgical intervention, or discontinuation of ACZ. The treatment group was more likely to experience side effects from ACZ prior to starting sodium bicarbonate therapy (p < 0.001). Among the treatment group, 92.7% remained on NaHCO<inf>3</inf> until IIH resolution, and 9 of 12 (75%) subjects reported significant improvement in ACZ-related side effects. Conclusion: Sodium bicarbonate does not appear to impact treatment outcomes in patients taking acetazolamide for IIH. Sodium bicarbonate may represent a reasonable adjunctive medication to help mitigate acetazolamide-related side effects in this group of patients. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Supercritical (sc) CO<inf>2</inf> in geologic carbon sequestration (GCS) can chemically and mechanically deteriorate wellbore cement, raising concerns for long-term operations. In contrast to the conventional view of “sulfate attack” on cement, we found that adding 0.15 M sulfate to the acidic brine can significantly reduce the impact of scCO<inf>2</inf> attack on Portland cement, resulting in stronger cement than that found in a sulfate-free system. Scanning electron microscopy revealed a decreased total attack depth in reacted cement in the presence of sulfate. With a newly defined minimum porosity term in reactive transport modeling, our model suggests that sulfate caused CaCO<inf>3</inf> to fill more nanopore spaces in the cement. Small angle X-ray scattering experiments also showed that sulfate can decrease the pore sizes of the carbonate layer. The results suggest that the interactions between sulfate and cement can generate a less porous CaCO<inf>3</inf> layer, which better resists acidic brine. Using this mechanism as a proof-of-concept, we tested the incorporation of sodium sulfate into Portland cement and synthesized new cement composites that show stronger resistance against scCO<inf>2</inf> attacks. These newly discovered interfacial interactions between CaCO<inf>3</inf> and sulfate provide new insights into engineering mechanically strong and green materials for safer GCS. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Urolithiasis is characterized by the deposition of uroliths (also known as calculi or stones) in the urinary tract. This condition is named obstructive urolithiasis in cases of obstruction of urine flow through the urethra by uroliths. Obstructive urolithiasis is the most frequent condition affecting goats' urinary tract. Usually, the etiology is linked to inadequate management practices. Goats raised as pets are at the highest risk for developing urolithiasis because the owners typically are not well instructed about adequate management, including correct feeding, age at castration, and general husbandry practices. Uroliths are formed of several pure or mixed compounds, mainly magnesium calcium phosphate, struvite (magnesium ammonium phosphate), magnesium potassium phosphate, calcium phosphate (apatite), and calcium carbonate. Obstructive urolithiasis is a condition that affects almost exclusively males. This difference is due to the anatomical conformation of the male urethra, which favors the deposition of uroliths. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - In this study, the antioxidant capacity, the effect on anti-acetylcholinesterase and anti-urease enzyme inhibition, and kidney stone-reducing effects of different extracts from M.myrtifolia. In addition, the phytochemical content of the bioactive methanol extract was analyzed by HPLC-DAD. The methanol extract showed strong DPPH (IC<inf>50</inf>:0.036 mg/mL) radical scavenging, Cu (II) ion (6.535 mmTroloxE) and Fe3+ (6.476 FeSO<inf>4</inf>) ion reducing antioxidant activity compared to other extracts. The methanol extract contained the highest amount of phenolic (400 mgGAE) and flavonoid (2.519 QuE) compounds. Moreover, the methanol extract had significant anticholinesterase (78.935%), anti-urease (71.014%) and calcium oxalate anti-crystallization (18.22%, 37.427%) activities. The findings show that all extracts exhibited varying amounts of antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus. The bioactive methanol extract contained rosmarinic acid (31.35 µg), quercetin (12.99 µg) and chlorogenic acid (3.55 µg). The analyzed compounds are thought to contribute significantly to the pharmacological effect of the methanol extract. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Chronic kidney disease (CKD) induces secondary osteoporosis, characterized by an imbalance between bone formation and resorption due to kidney dysfunction; the result is a reduction in both bone mineral density and quality. This condition is compounded by disruption of bone metabolic turnover, abnormalities in bone microstructure and collagen cross-linking, and compromised bone quality, all of which contribute to increased bone fragility. Reduced kidney function is complicated by secondary hyperparathyroidism, which exacerbates bone fragility. Managing osteoporosis in patients with CKD is challenging because drugs may be contraindicated or require cautious administration, particularly those with high urinary excretion rates. In addition, severe hypercalcemia or hypocalcemia may develop in these patients following administration of active vitamin D or denosumab, respectively. The choice of pharmacotherapy depends on the stage of CKD; however, evidence for the safety and efficacy of osteoporosis drugs in moderate to severe cases of CKD, particularly stages G4, G5, and G5D (i.e., dialysis patients), is limited. This article focuses on the pathophysiology of CKD-associated osteoporosis, as well as the increased fracture risk, and provides a concise overview of safety considerations regarding administration of osteoporosis drugs in Japan. The data presented highlight the complexities associated with drug use in patients with CKD. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Urolithiasis is one of the most common urological diseases, and its incidence has increased globally in recent years. Multiple potential mechanisms are involved in urolithiasis, including renal oxidative stress, inflammatory response, fibrosis, pyroptosis, and gut microbiota disturbance. Sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO<inf>3</inf>) is commonly used clinically to alkalize urine and slow the progression of chronic kidney disease, including urolithiasis. However, the specific mechanism of NaHCO<inf>3</inf> in the treatment of urolithiasis is unclear. Methods: In this study, we constructed a mice urolithiasis model via intraperitoneal injection of glyoxylate (50 mg/kg) for one week in C57BL/6 mice. Meanwhile, 5% NaHCO<inf>3</inf> was added to drinking water in the treatment group. Biochemical detection, immunohistochemical staining, RT-qPCR, and Western blotting were used to assess kidney function and levels of inflammation and pyroptosis. The alteration of gut microbiota in mice treated with NaHCO<inf>3</inf> was measured using 16S rDNA sequencing. Results: The results demonstrated that NaHCO<inf>3</inf> effectively reduced the deposition of CaOx crystal, as well as restored kidney function in urolithiasis-induced kidney injury mice. Moreover, NaHCO<inf>3</inf> alleviated oxidative stress and inflammatory response and ameliorated pyroptosis by modulating the NLRP3 inflammasome pathway in kidney. Additionally, it enhanced the intestinal barrier function by up-regulating the expression of tight junction proteins (ZO-1, occludin, and claudin 5), remodeling the gut microbiota, and reducing intestinal inflammation. Conclusion: In summary, NaHCO<inf>3</inf> exerted a protective effect via the gut-kidney axis in the urolithiasis mice model, suggesting its potential use as a dietary supplementation to be added to daily drinking water for the management of urolithiasis. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Aims: Hypoparathyroidism is a disorder that causes renal complications, bone disease, an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases, neuromuscular complications, and ocular findings. In this study, we aimed to determine how well the existing guidelines were followed in the follow-up of patients with hypoparathyroidism. Materials and Methods: In the endocrinology and metabolism outpatient clinic, routine controls were conducted on patients 18 years of age and older with a diagnosis of hypoparathyroidism between February 2019 and September 2021. These individuals’ test findings, imaging, hormones, and additional disorders were assessed. Results: The mean age of 264 patients included in the study was 49.34 ± 12.98 (22–91). Of the patients, 211 (79.9%) were female. Blood biochemistry tests were performed on all patients. Ophthalmological examination was performed in 3% of the patients, brain imaging in 9.8%, renal imaging in 18.6%, and 24-h urinary Ca measurements in 11%. According to the results of the examinations, cataract was found in 2 (0.8%) patients and basal ganglia calcification was found in 4 (1.5%) patients. In addition, nephrocalcinosis or nephrolithiasis was seen in 2 patients (0.8%). Hypercalciuria was defined as a 24-h urinary calcium excretion of > 300 mg/24 h for males and > 250 mg/dL for females and was detected in 12 patients with hypoparathyroidism. Conclusion: In our research, it was discovered that patients with hypoparathyroidism had low compliance rates with the guidelines. We believe that the cause of this is the inability to provide the patients with enough time in intense polyclinic conditions. Given the information gathered from our study, it has been concluded that complication screening in hypoparathyroidism patients is just as crucial as blood tests and that allocating enough time for patients will enhance their follow-up and treatment. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Background/Objectives: Vitamin D receptor (VDR) agonists are commonly used in clinical practice for their roles in calcium regulation and potential benefits in various diseases. However, their safety profiles, particularly for compounds available as food supplements, remain underexplored in real-world settings. This study aimed to analyze the safety profiles of VDR agonists using the EudraVigilance database, focusing on adverse drug reactions (ADRs) reported between 1 January 2004 and 23 June 2024. Methods: Data for ten VDR agonists were collected, de-duplicated, and analyzed to identify specific safety signals. Risk factors for specific ADRs were assessed using multiple logistic regression. Results: This study analyzed 5,369,581 reports in the EudraVigilance system, from which 17,947 reports (0.33%) involving 80,050 ADRs were linked to VDR agonists. The most-reported drugs were cholecalciferol (12,944 cases) and calcitriol (1355 cases). Serious ADRs were more prevalent with paricalcitol, alfacalcidol, and calcitriol than with cholecalciferol (p < 0.05). Hypercalcemia was a hallmark ADR for all VDR agonists, with the highest risk linked to dihydrotachysterol (ROR = 5668; 95%CI = 3332 to 9641; p < 0.0001), alfacalcidol (ROR = 965.7; 95%CI = 843.6 to 1106; p < 0.0001), and calcitriol (ROR = 726.0; 95%CI = 634.6 to 830.5; p < 0.0001). Logistic regression highlighted dehydration, overdose, and concomitant administration of calcium salts as major predictors of hypercalcemia. The co-administration of multiple VDR agonists was also found to increase hypercalcemia risk. However, the disproportionality analysis showed that only active VDR agonists (e.g., calcitriol, alfacalcidol) were associated with severe complications like renal and urinary disorders and cardiac issues due to hypercalcemia. Natural precursors (cholecalciferol, ergocalciferol) were more often linked to non-calcemic ADRs such as gastrointestinal symptoms, which were more prevalent in infants and children compared to adults. Conclusions: The safety profiles of VDR agonists differ significantly between compounds. Active derivatives require close monitoring for serious calcemia-related complications, whereas cholecalciferol is associated with less severe ADRs, primarily in at-risk populations. These findings highlight the need for targeted safety monitoring and further research into the real-world uses of VDR agonists. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - To assess outcomes of supracostal ultrasound guided approach percutaneous nephrolithotomy (SUGA-PNL) and retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS) in isolated large volume upper calyceal stones (UCS). This was a prospective randomized study including patients with isolated UCS > 20mm. The patients were randomized into two groups: group (P) (SUGA-PNL) and group (R) (RIRS). Patients’ demographics, stones characteristics, operative, and postoperative outcomes essentially the stone free rate (SFR) and complications rate were documented. The stone clearance was defined as no fragments or residual fragments less than 2mm in the one month non contrast CT scan follow up. Eighty-nine patients opted to undergo the procedure according to the preoperative randomization. Four patients, 2 patients from each group, lost to follow up and other 2 patients were excluded from group (R) due to a tight ureter. Both groups were comparable as regards the preoperative demographics and stone characteristics. There were statistically significant differences regarding total operative time, the change in hemoglobin level, and postoperative pain score (P: 0.024, 0.010 and 0.032 respectively). The SFR was 88.1% in group (P) compared to 73.2% in group (R) (P: 0.019). Moreover, it did not differ significantly between both groups regarding the intraoperative and postoperative complications. No visceral and thoracic injuries were documented in group (P). On other side, 6 patients (14.6%) from group (R) had different grades of ureteral injury during access sheath placement. SUGA-PNL is a safe and effective treatment modality for UCS > 20mm with a higher SFR than RIRS. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The feline ureter is susceptible to obstruction caused by various factors, including lithiasis, stenosis, neoplasia and retrocaval ureter. However, lithiasis stands as the primary cause, followed by ureteral strictures. Clinical manifestations in affected cats are often nonspecific, contingent upon the degree and laterality of obstruction, with azotaemia being a prominent consequence. This study aims to document a surgical intervention employing a double J catheter in a cat presenting with ureteral obstruction. A 12-year-old, male cat presented with anuria, sporadic vomiting, weight loss and anorexia. Laboratory exams revealed severe azotaemia, corroborated by ultrasonography displaying a pseudocyst and signs indicative of ureteral obstruction. Consequently, hospitalisation ensued with exploratory laparotomy surgery. During the procedure, a left nephrectomy became necessary. Utilisation of the double J catheter in the right ureter was pivotal, alongside right ureteral transposition and catheter insertion for peritoneal dialysis. After surgery, peritoneal dialysis commenced promptly. A significant reduction in azotaemia was observed by the end of hospitalisation, along with normal urination and spontaneous feeding. The efficacy of employing the double J ureteral catheter was evident in restoring urinary flow and expediting the patient's recovery period, as evidenced by the data presented. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Patients with primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) are at risk for severe hypocalcemia (SH) following parathyroidectomy (PTX), but limited data exist on the predictors of SH. We aimed to identify risk factors for early postoperative SH after PTX in patients with PHPT and to evaluate the predictive value of clinical parameters. Methods: A retrospective review of patients with PHPT who underwent PTX between January 2010 and December 2022 was performed. A total of 46 patients were included in the study, with 15 (32.6%) experiencing postoperative SH, 19 (41.3%) having calculi in the ureter or kidney, and 37 (80.4%) having osteoporosis. Patients were divided into SH and non-SH groups based on postoperative serum calcium levels. Preoperative biochemical indicators, bone turnover markers, and renal function parameters were analyzed and correlated with postoperative SH. Results: Statistically significant (P < 0.05) differences were found in preoperative serum calcium (serum Ca), intact parathyroid hormone, serum phosphorus (serum P), serum Ca/P, percentage decrease of serum Ca, total procollagen type 1 intact N-terminal propeptide, osteocalcin (OC), and alkaline phosphatase levels between the two groups. Multivariate analysis showed that serum P (odds ratio [OR] = 0.989; 95% confidence interval [95% CI] = 0.981–0.996; P = 0.003), serum Ca (OR = 0.007; 95% CI = 0.001–0.415; P = 0.017), serum Ca/P (OR = 0.135; 95% CI = 0.019–0.947; P = 0.044) and OC levels (OR = 1.012; 95% CI = 1.001–1.024; P = 0.036) were predictors of early postoperative SH. The receiver operating characteristic curve analysis revealed that serum P (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.859, P < 0.001), serum Ca/P (AUC = 0.735, P = 0.010) and OC (AUC = 0.729, P = 0.013) had high sensitivity and specificity. Conclusion: Preoperative serum P, serum Ca/P and osteocalcin levels may identify patients with PHPT at risk for early postoperative SH after PTX. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: To analyze preoperatively the composition of renal calculi using dual-energy computed tomography (DECT) and compare it with reference standard biochemical stone analysis. Methods: Eighty-one participants who were diagnosed with renal calculi underwent DECT at 80 kVp and 140 kVp. Spectral analysis was performed, and the energy map generated was used to classify the calculus based on available preset data. Average Hounsfield units (HU) were calculated for the two energy levels, and ratio of HU was derived (DE ratio) and calculus was categorized into different stone compositions. Hounsfield units of each calculus was measured at 120 kVp standard dose CT, and Hounsfield density (HU/largest transverse diameter) was derived. Comparison of results of spectral analysis and DE ratio was done and correlated with the biochemical laboratory analysis as reference standard wherever available. Results: Spectral analysis and CT prediction of stone were performed for all 81 patients. CT prediction of stone based on DE ratio into “uric acid,” “struvite,” “calcium oxalate” and “calcium carbonate apatite” was performed. Assessment of stone composition by biochemical analysis was done for 65 patients who eventually underwent PCNL for stone extraction. Both DE ratio and spectral analysis were able to differentiate calculus into various types based on composition with statistically significant p values. However, spectral analysis proved to be marginally better in renal stone characterization particularly for mixed stones. The DE ratio for uric acid stones was derived as 0.9–1.1, 0.9–2.3 for mixed stones and 1.0–2.4 for calcium stones. Conclusions: Spectral analysis promises a practical approach to predicting calculus composition preoperatively, thereby avoiding unnecessary surgical intervention. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Aims/Background Hyperuricemia is a metabolic disorder characterized by elevated levels of uric acid in the blood. If left untreated, hyperuricemia can progress to gout, which manifests as acute arthritic attacks, and may also lead to uric acid nephrolithiasis and other renal conditions. This widespread condition poses significant risks to human health and quality of life. This study retrospectively evaluated the effectiveness and safety of using benzbromarone in combination with sodium bicarbonate tablets for the treatment of gout associated with hyperuricemia. Methods The study reviewed the electronic medical records (EMR) of 150 patients with gout and hyperuricemia who were admitted to our hospital between May 2018 and December 2023. These patients were divided into two groups: a control group and a research group. The control group received oral sodium bicarbonate tablets, while the research group was treated with oral benzbromarone tablets in addition to sodium bicarbonate tablets. The study compared the treatment outcomes and adverse reactions between the two groups, as well as assessed changes in blood-related indicators, the number of tophi, pain levels, and quality of life before and after treatment. Results The research group demonstrated a higher total effective rate compared to the control group (p < 0.05). Post-treatment, the research group exhibited significantly lower levels of serum uric acid (UA), serum creatinine (Scr), and urea (p < 0.05). Additionally, this group had fewer tophi and lower visual analog scale (VAS) scores compared to the control group (p < 0.05). Quality of life scores were also significantly higher in the research group (p < 0.05). No statistically significant difference was found in the incidence of adverse drug reactions between the two groups (p > 0.05). Conclusion The combination of benzbromarone and sodium bicarbonate tablets is highly effective in treating gout associated with hyperuricemia. This treatment not only reduces uric acid levels and the number of tophi but also enhances renal function, alleviates pain, and improves the overall quality of life for patients. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Maternal nutrition during pregnancy is known to have an effect on fetal growth and development. It is recommended that women increase their calcium intake during pregnancy and lactation, although the recommended dosage varies among professionals. Currently, there is no consensus on the role of routine calcium supplementation for pregnant women other than for preventing or treating hypertension. Objectives: To determine the effect of calcium supplementation on maternal, fetal and neonatal outcomes, excluding women with multiple gestation (other than for preventing or treating hypertension), including the occurrence of adverse effects. Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (which includes results of comprehensive searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, two trials registers and relevant conference proceedings) on 3 December 2022. We also searched the reference lists of retrieved studies. Selection criteria: We considered all published, unpublished and ongoing randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing maternal, fetal and neonatal outcomes in pregnant women who received calcium supplementation versus placebo or no treatment. Cluster-RCTs were eligible for inclusion but none were identified. Quasi-RCTs and cross-over studies were not eligible for inclusion. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion. At least one review author assessed trials meeting the inclusion criteria for trustworthiness, consulting another review author in cases that were not immediately clear. Two review authors independently assessed the studies for risk of bias, extracted data, and checked trials for accuracy. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE. Main results: Twenty-one studies met the inclusion criteria, but only 19 studies contributed data to the review. These 19 trials recruited 17,370 women, with 16,625 women included in the final analyses. The trials were generally at low risk of bias for randomisation and allocation concealment. We chose three outcomes for GRADE assessment: preterm birth less than 37 weeks, preterm birth less than 34 weeks and low birthweight (less than 2500 g). All trials compared calcium supplementation with placebo or no treatment with 17 trials comparing high-dose calcium (greater than 1000 mg/day). Calcium supplementation probably slightly reduces the risk of preterm birth less than 37 weeks (average risk ratio (RR) 0.80, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.65 to 0.99; 11 trials, 15,379 women; moderate-certainty evidence), but probably has little effect on the risk of preterm birth less than 34 weeks (average RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.35; 3 trials, 5569 women; moderate-certainty evidence), and may have little or no effect on low birthweight (less than 2500 g) (average RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.07; 6 trials, 14,162 women; low-certainty evidence; 1 study reported low birthweight (less than 2500 g) but recorded 0 events in both groups. Thus, the RR and CIs were calculated from 5 studies rather than 6). We downgraded the evidence for imprecision (wide CIs crossing the line of no effect) and inconsistency (high levels of heterogeneity between the studies). There was no evidence that calcium supplementation had any effect on maternal weight gain during pregnancy; increasing bone mineral density in pregnant women; rate of intrauterine growth restriction; perinatal mortality; stillbirth or fetal death rate; increase birth length or fetal head circumference; and adverse effects such as postpartum haemorrhage, gall stones, gastrointestinal symptoms, headache, urinary stones, urinary tract infection or impaired renal function. Authors' conclusions: This review indicates that calcium supplementation probably reduces preterm birth before 37 weeks. There are no clear additional benefits to calcium supplementation in preterm birth before 34 weeks or prevention of low birthweight. Large multicentre trials to detect the effect of calcium supplementation on fetal birthweight and preterm birth before 34 weeks as the primary outcomes are needed. Further research into the short- and long-term effects of calcium supplementation would also be beneficial. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Lapis judaicus, or Jews stone (Badarashma), has been used in treating kidney and bladder stones since ancient times by Ayurvedic and Unani medicinal practitioners. A limited number of studies have been carried out using Ayurvedic preparations derived from gems or precious stones that were used traditionally. In Ayurveda, Rasa Shastra includes the fabrication of Bhasmas and Pishti. Objective: This study aimed to prepare and characterize Badarashma Pishti formulation (Lapis judaicus microparticles) and investigate its structural and thermal properties. Materials and methods: The microparticles were prepared by subjecting purified powder of Lapis judaicus to a wet levigation (Bhavana) process. Characterizations were done using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermo-gravimetry analysis (TGA), energy-dispersive X-ray (EDAX) spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis. Physicochemical characterization, elemental analysis, particle size distribution study, and identification of heavy metals were also performed. Results: A standard operating procedure was developed to formulate Badarashma Pishti. The obtained microparticles were irregularly shaped with a size of 4.290 ± 0.472 μm, confirmed in SEM images. The FTIR and XRD of prepared Badarashma Pishti samples revealed the presence of calcite, quartz, and aragonite minerals. The results of EDAX also confirmed the presence of Ca, Mg, O, and Si elements. Conclusion: The proposed study results reveal great insights for determining the authenticity, purity, and standardization parameters of inorganic mineral drugs, proving to be a useful delivery system for treating renal calculi. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Urinary stone disease is a prevalent health issue worldwide, with varying incidence influenced by multiple factors. This study aims to provide the first comprehensive analysis of urinary stone composition in Azerbaijan. Methods: A retrospective study was conducted on 1465 patients, aged 1‒83 years, who underwent biochemical urinary stone analysis at the Department of Renal Diseases and Organ Transplantation, Azerbaijan State Security Service Military Hospital, between April 2015 and December 2023. Stone samples were analyzed using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. Statistical analyses were performed using the IBM® SPSS software version 29.0. Results: The cohort had a median age of 45 years, with a male-to-female ratio of 1.65:1. Calcium oxalate stones were the most common (56.2%), followed by uric acid (33.7%), struvite (5.3%), cystine (2.5%), calcium phosphate (1.9%), and xanthine (0.1%) stones. Men had a higher prevalence of calcium oxalate and uric acid stones, while women had more struvite stones. Mixed stones were common, particularly among uric acid and struvite stones. Significant differences in stone composition were observed between age groups and genders, with uric acid stones found predominantly in older individuals. Conclusion: This study highlights the predominance of calcium oxalate stones and the elevated prevalence of uric acid stones in Azerbaijan, emphasizing the need for tailored diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. The high prevalence of mixed stones underscores the complexity of urinary stone disease and the need for comprehensive metabolic evaluation and individualized preventive strategies. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: The beneficial effects of oral supplements with alkalinizing agents in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) have been limited to the severe stages. We investigated whether two types of supplements, sodium bicarbonate (SB) and potassium citrate/sodium citrate (PCSC), could maintain renal function in patients with mild-stage CKD. Methods: This was a single-center, open-labeled, randomized cohort trial. Study participants with CKD stages G2, G3a, and G3b were enrolled between March 2013 and January 2019 and randomly assigned by stratification according to age, sex, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and diabetes. They were followed up for 6 months (short-term study) for the primary endpoints and extended to 2 years (long-term study) for the secondary endpoints. Supplementary doses were adjusted to achieve an early morning urinary pH of 6.8–7.2. We observed renal dysfunction or new-onset cerebrovascular disease and evaluated urinary surrogate markers for renal injury. Results: Overall, 101 participants were registered and allocated to three groups: standard (n = 32), SB (n = 34), and PCSC (n = 35). Two patients in the standard group attained the primary endpoints (renal stones and overt proteinuria) but were not statistically significant. There was one patient in the standard reduced eGFR during the long-term study (p = 0.042 by ANOVA). SB increased proteinuria (p = 0.0139, baseline vs. 6 months), whereas PCSC significantly reduced proteinuria (p = 0.0061, baseline vs. 1 year, or p = 0.0186, vs. 2 years) and urinary excretion of 8-hydroxy-2′-deoxyguanosine (p = 0.0481, baseline vs. 6 months). Conclusion: This study is the first to report supplementation of PCSC reduced intrarenal oxidative stress in patients with mild-stage CKD.

AB  - Objective: Oral dissolution therapy is a recognised treatment option for radiolucent kidney stones. A standardised nurse-led protocol was developed. Efficacy and compliance was audited and results reviewed. Methods: Twenty-two patients with radiolucent stones were prescribed oral sodium bicarbonate. Patients monitored their urinary pH and the Urology Nurse Practitioner checked compliance. Follow-up with non-contrast computerised tomography of the kidneys, ureters and bladder (CT KUB) was evaluated at 6 weeks. Results: Twenty patients with radiolucent stones completed treatment. Mean stone size was 8 mm (2–23 mm). Nine patients (45%) had complete dissolution, three (15%) had partial dissolution and eight (40%) had no visible response on follow-up CT KUB. The Hounsfield unit (HU) average was 464 (116–1285). Those patients with complete dissolution had HU of less than 605. Three patients with encrusted ureteric stents underwent complete dissolution. Conclusions: Utilisation of a nurse-led sodium bicarbonate dissolution therapy protocol for the treatment of radiolucent stones is effective and acceptable to patients in carefully selected cases. Orally dissolution therapy (ODT) is a suitable option in patients with multiple co-morbidities and high anaesthetic risk. In our series, ODT was also highly effective in treating radiolucent stent encrustation. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is a disorder in which excessive parathyroid hormone (PTH) is secreted from the parathyroid glands. The cause of PHPT is most commonly parathyroid lesions such as parathyroid adenoma. The clinical manifestations of PHPT include hypercalcemia, nephrolithiasis, bone disease and rarely pathological fractures and brown tumors, which arise within the foci of osteitis fibrosa. Brown tumors are benign intraosseous tumors that occur because of excessive osteoclast activity. Because of advances in medical care, early diagnosis and treatment have meant that diagnosing PHPT in the setting of multiple brown tumors is particularly rare. Here, we present a case of a young man with prolonged PHPT from a giant parathyroid adenoma with multiple brown tumors causing pathological fractures. Definitive treatment of PHPT is parathyroidectomy with particular attention to the risks for hungry bone syndrome (HBS) postoperatively. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Between 2006 and 2014, 10 cases of urolithiasis in yaks with calcium carbonate uroliths were confirmed in Switzerland, and at the same time, a sixfold calcium overhang in roughage in an affected farm was evident. The purpose of this study was the question of whether urolithiasis in yaks in the alpine regions of Switzerland poses a husbandry risk. The hypothesis was that elevated calcium levels in roughage led to hypercalcemia and, thus, the formation of calcium carbonate stones. Methods: Blood samples from 99 animals from 10 farms were examined (n = 6 problem farms; n = 4 control farms). Several metabolites were analyzed in the blood and urine. In addition, roughage, soil, and water samples were analyzed. The farms were distributed within different regions of Switzerland. Results: This study revealed different Ca:P ratios, from 1.56 to 7.74:1, in the forages and mild hypercalcemia in the animals of the problem farms. In a univariate analysis of the problem versus control farms, about 20 other significant factors emerged. Multivariate analysis showed that altitude, CP (crude protein), P, Mg, NDF, and ADF in the diet are important factors. Based on analysis of the pedigree, there was no evidence of an obvious genetic background of urolithiasis. Limitations: A limitation of this study is the small number of yaks in Switzerland. Conclusions: The question of whether urolithiasis in yaks in alpine Switzerland poses a husbandry risk can be answered affirmatively. Calcium-rich forages play a crucial role in this multifactorial process. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Dent disease is a rare disease with proximal renal tubular dysfunction, and is characterized by low-molecular-weight proteinuria, hypercalciuria, nephrocalcinosis, nephrolithiasis, and chronic kidney disease. Renal failure slowly progresses and end-stage renal disease may develop in the late decades of life. We report a case of a 15-year-old boy who was diagnosed with Dent disease 1 with a CLCN5 truncating mutation. The patient presented with arthralgia and rickets at the onset of Dent disease and he was diagnosed with end-stage renal disease at the age of 15 years. His only symptoms were arthralgia and rickets during the disease course. The findings in this case suggest that patients with arthralgia and rickets could have a rare cause such as Dent disease. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Trace element (TEs) contamination in groundwater is a key factor for health risk assessment and one of the environmental challenges linked with Ghana’s sustainable development. This study aims to investigate TE concentrations in groundwater used for drinking and domestic purposes and their potential health risk in the Kumasi Metropolis using multivariate statistics. In the study, 23 groundwater samples were analyzed for 32 TEs using Perkin Elmer Nexion 2000 Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometer (ICP-MS). Levels of TEs recorded in the study were in order of Na > Si > Ca > K > Mg > S > Ba > Cu > Zn > Al > Sr > Li > Mn > P > Fe > B > Pb > Ni > Co > Bi > Se > Sb > Cr > As > Ti > Be > V > U > C d > T l > Mo > Hg. The study revealed that the concentration of trace and toxic elements like Al, Cu, and Pb exceeded their corresponding WHO permissible standards. Hazard index (HI) values and total likely cancer risk (TLCR) values for non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic health risks indicate that 91.3% of the total sampling sites presented health concerns to adults and children. The mean TLCR values associated with exposure to carcinogenic metals via ingestion of groundwater samples were estimated to be 2.09 × 10−4 and 4.44 × 10−4 for adults and children respectively. Exposure through the ingestion pathway was found to be more risky compared to dermal contacts. Children are particularly vulnerable to these health hazards. Pearson correlation (PC) matrix, principal component analysis (PCA), and hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) suggested that sources of TEs in the groundwater are attributed to both anthropogenic and geogenic factors. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Permanent hypoparathyroidism is a significant complication after total thyroidectomy. This study aimed to evaluate the long-term impact of postoperative permanent hypoparathyroidism on kidney outcomes. Methods: Data of patients undergoing total thyroidectomy from 1999 to 2014 were retrieved. The estimated glomerular filtration rate was determined from serum creatinine results. Permanent hypoparathyroidism was defined as requiring oral calcium and vitamin D supplements postoperatively for at least 6 months. The primary outcome was a sustained decline in the estimated glomerular filtration rate from baseline by ≥50%. Secondary outcomes were end-stage kidney disease (a composite of sustained estimated glomerular filtration rate <15 mL/min/1.73 m2, need for dialysis, and kidney transplantation) and rate of estimated glomerular filtration rate decline. Patients with and without permanent hypoparathyroidism were compared. Multivariable Cox regression analysis was performed to identify independent risk factors for sustained estimated glomerular filtration rate decline by ≥50%. Results: In total, 3,245 patients were eligible for analysis; 418 patients (12.9%) had permanent hypoparathyroidism. Upon median follow-up of 11.6 years, more patients with permanent hypoparathyroidism had a sustained decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate from baseline by ≥50% compared to those without (15.6% vs 6.9%, P < .001). Similar findings were obtained on Kaplan–Meier analysis (P < .001). Permanent hypoparathyroidism was an independent risk factor for sustained estimated glomerular filtration rate decline by ≥50% (adjusted hazard ratio 2.77, P < .001). Other risk factors included age, preoperative estimated glomerular filtration rate <60 mL/min/1.73m2, and diabetes mellitus. Patients with permanent hypoparathyroidism had a more rapid estimated glomerular filtration rate decline (–1.60 vs –0.70 mL/min/1.73 m2/year, difference –0.91 mL/min/1.73m2/year, P < .001). Conclusion: Patients with postsurgical permanent hypoparathyroidism were at greater risk of renal impairment. Further research is warranted to improve the identification and preservation of parathyroid glands during thyroidectomy to minimize patient morbidity. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Crystalline material can cause a multitude of acute and chronic inflammatory diseases, such as gouty arthritis, silicosis, kidney disease, and atherosclerosis. Crystals of various types are thought to cause similar inflammatory responses, including the release of proinflammatory mediators and formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), processes that further promote necroinflammation and tissue damage. It has become apparent that the intensity of inflammation and the related mechanisms of NET formation and neutrophil death in crystal-associated diseases can vary depending on the crystal type, amount, and site of deposition. This review details new mechanistic insights into crystal biology, highlights the differential effects of various crystals on neutrophils and extracellular trap (ET) formation, and discusses treatment strategies and potential future approaches for crystal-associated disorders. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Type of feed is an important consideration in herbivore colony management, yet limited studies report on the effects of diet on common conditions such as urolithiasis in guinea pigs. Urolithiasis is a well-documented cause of lower urinary tract disease in guinea pigs, with calcium carbonate uroliths reported as the predominant calculi formed in the guinea pig urinary tract. A calcium-rich diet has been suggested as a risk factor for of urolithiasis, with numerous commercially available guinea pig diets formulated for adults avoiding ingredients that are higher in calcium. Due to the high incidence of urolithiasis in our strain 13/N guinea pig colony, we conducted a prospective control study following the implementation of dietary changes aimed at improving overall urinary tract health and reducing risk factors for urolithiasis, thus improving colony welfare. A control group was kept on the original ad libitum alfalfa hay–based pellet diet with restricted loose timothy hay (control diet, 14 juveniles and 24 adults). An experimental group was placed on a portioned, 1 oz daily, timothy hay–based pellet diet with ad libitum loose timothy hay (experimental diet, 21 juveniles and 23 adults). Juveniles and adults were followed for a total of 14 and 26 wk, respectively. Longitudinal blood and urine samples were collected to evaluate blood chemistry and urinary parameters, along with weight and body condition scores to assess general health. Overall, dietary changes did not improve parameters associated with improved urinary tract health or reduced risk of urolithiasis; feeding strategy was not found to meaningfully affect calcium crystalluria, urine protein, urine specific gravity, or renal values. These data support alfalfa hay–based pellet or timothy hay–based pellet, when fed with loose timothy hay, as viable options and suggest that practices aimed at reducing dietary calcium by reducing pelleted diet portions are insufficient to mitigate risk factors for urolithiasis in guinea pigs. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Objectives: Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) in paediatric and adolescent age group presents with some unique challenges for clinicians. While the disease in the adult counterparts presents with symptoms which are described quite extensively in literature, children/adolescents have manifestations which are quite different and severe compared to the former. The present case series aimed to highlight the peculiarities of presentation of PHPT in children and adolescents. Case presentation: In this case series, we present experience of 5 cases of PHPT in children and adolescents from our centre. We compared our data with the data already available in literature. We have also described salient presenting features of PHPT in individuals less than 19 years old previously reported in literature and pointed out the specificities of this disease at this age group. Conclusions: PHPT in children and adolescents should be considered as a separate entity compared to that in adults, given its unique features, such as rachitic features, and severity of different presenting phenotypes. Persistence of rachitic features despite vitamin D correction, pancreatitis, bilateral nephrolithiasis and otherwise unexplained psychiatric abnormalities of insidious onset require greater clinical vigilance and serum/urine calcium testing to rule out this uncommon yet possible entity. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Introduction: Urolithiasis is one of the most prevailing diseases in the society. Conventional treatments are symptomatic and are not targeted to direct the dissolution of ureteric calculi. Thus, in this study plants like Cinnamomum verum (Lauraceae) (C. verum) and Nigella sativa (Ranunculaceae) (N. sativa) are selected to assess for their lithotriptic activity. Materials and Methods: The combinations of hydroalcoholic extract of these plants were prepared (HaNsCv). Ureteric calculi of human origin were sampled from patients post lithotripsy. The sampled calculi were weighed and incubated ex vivo with various concentrations of HaNsCv extract like 50, 100, 200 and 400 mg in tris buffer (pH 7) at 37ºC. The change in the size of ureteric calculi was monitored at interval of 24 hr post for a period of 9 days. Results and Discussion: Amongst various concentration tested, the dissolution of ureteric calculi was initiated within 24 hr at dose 400 mg whereas remaining concentrations exhibited lithotriptic activity after 24 hr of incubation. Dissolution of ureteric calculi observed was found to be both dose dependent and time dependent. At the end on 9th day 100% dissolution of ureteric calculi was observed at dose 400 mg of HaNsCv extract. LCMS study depicted presence of flavonoids like quercetin, rutin, etc., which would have been responsible for the observed lithotriptic effect. Results obtained indicate that HaNsCv possess lithotriptic potential useful for management of urolithiasis. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Oxalic acid and oxalates are secondary metabolites secreted to the surrounding environment by fungi, bacteria, and plants. Oxalates are linked to a variety of processes in soil, e.g. nutrient availability, weathering of minerals, or precipitation of metal oxalates. Oxalates are also mentioned among low-molecular weight compounds involved indirectly in the degradation of the lignocellulose complex by fungi, which are considered to be the most effective degraders of wood. The active regulation of the oxalic acid concentration is linked with enzymatic activities; hence, the biochemistry of microbial biosynthesis and degradation of oxalic acid has also been presented. The potential of microorganisms for oxalotrophy and the ability of microbial enzymes to degrade oxalates are important factors that can be used in the prevention of kidney stone, as a diagnostic tool for determination of oxalic acid content, as an antifungal factor against plant pathogenic fungi, or even in efforts to improve the quality of edible plants. The potential role of fungi and their interaction with bacteria in the oxalate-carbonate pathway are regarded as an effective way for the transfer of atmospheric carbon dioxide into calcium carbonate as a carbon reservoir. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Introduction: Patients with Chronic hypoparathyroidism (CHPT) receiving conventional treatment are exposed to several long-term complications including basal ganglia calcifications, posterior subcapsular cataract, kidney stones, and renal insufficiency. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence and the associated factors of these complications in patients with CHPT. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study including 58 patients with CHPT. All participants underwent physical examination, biochemical assessment (total serum calcium, serum phosphorus, serum albumin, intact-PTH, serum magnesium, 25-hydroxy-vitamin D, serum creatinine, thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), and 24-hour urinary calcium), slit lamp examination, brain computed tomography scan (CT-scan), and renal ultrasound. Results: Participants had a mean age of 52.6 ± 16.4 years and a gender ratio (women/men) of 3.5. Fahr syndrome, cataract, urolithiasis, and renal failure were found in 55%, 62%, 12%, and 17% of cases, respectively. CHPT duration >15 years (Adjusted-OR = 43.1, 95-CI: 2.63–703.06, p = 0.008) and poor adherence to treatment (Adjusted-OR = 8.04, 95%-CI: 1.52–42.42, p = 0.014) were independently associated with the risk of Fahr syndrome. Age >55 years (adjusted-OR = 5.07, 95-CI: 1.10–23.42, p = 0.037), disease duration >15 years (adjusted-OR = 20.21, 95-CI: 1.54–265.84, p = 0.022), and magnesium level <0.8 mmol/l (adjusted-OR = 36.46, 95-CI: 3.75–354.08, p = 0.002) were independently associated with the risk of subcapsular cataract. Only hypercalciuria (Adjusted-OR = 21.27, 95-CI: 2.31–195.91, p = 0.007) was an independent risk factor for kidney stones. Renal failure was not associated with kidney stones (p = 1). However, creatinine clearance was negatively correlated with age (r = −0.784; p < 10−3) and disease duration (r = −0.352; p = 0.007). Conclusion: Our results revealed high prevalences of neurological, ocular, and renal complications in patients with CHPT and emphasized the importance of regular biological monitoring, therapeutic adjustments, screening, and adherence to treatment in the prevention of these complications. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) coupled with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) enables the determination of the composition and structure of tiny calcified remains occasionally recovered during burial excavations. To deepen the practical application of this technique, we performed SEM/EDX analysis on three different tiny mineralized, roughly rounded structures with a diameter of less than 5 mm recovered from a pre-Hispanic collective funerary cave from El Hierro (Canary Islands) and a mineral spherulite of similar size and outer aspect. After SEM imaging and spectroscopic analysis, we conclude that the three samples represent a sesamoid bone, a kidney stone, and a possible case of sialolithiasis. In contrast, the spherulite is a mineral formation composed of calcium carbonate. Our data confirm SEM analysis's usefulness in identifying small, mineralized remains recovered during burial excavations and its contribution to studying past populations. However, we are aware that taphonomic changes may alter, at least partially, the structure, and/or elemental composition of archaeological samples, obscuring differential diagnosis. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Introduction: The causal relationship between hyperparathyroidism and kidney graft dysfunction remains inconclusive. Applying Bradford-Hill's temporality and consistency causation principles, we assessed the effect of parathyroid hormone (iPTH) on graft histology and eGFR trajectory on kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) with normal time-zero graft biopsies. Methods: Retrospective cohort study evaluating the effect of hyperparathyroidism on interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy (IF/TA) development in 1232 graft biopsies. Pre-transplant hyperparathyroidism was categorized by KDIGO or KDOQI criteria, and post-transplant hyperparathyroidism by iPTH >1× and >2× the URL 1 year after transplantation. Results: We included 325 KTRs (56% female, age 38 ± 13 years, follow-up 4.2 years [IQR: 2.7-5.8]). Based on pre-transplant iPTH levels, 26% and 66% exceeded the KDIGO and KDOQI targets, respectively. There were no significant differences in the development of >25% IF/TA between KTRs with pre-transplant iPTH levels above and within target range according to KDIGO (53% vs. 62%, P =.16, HR.94 [95% CI:.67–1.32]) and KDOQI (60% vs. 60%, P = 1.0, HR 1.19 [95% CI:.88–1.60]) criteria. Similarly, there were no differences when using 1 year post-transplant iPTH cut-offs > 88 pg/mL (58% vs. 64%, P =.33) and > 176 pg/mL (55% vs. 62%, P =.19). After adjusting for confounders, no significant differences were observed in eGFR trajectories among the iPTH strata. Conclusion: In young KTRs who received a healthy graft, no association was found between increased pre- and post-transplant iPTH levels and graft dysfunction, as assessed histologically and through eGFR trajectory. The concept of hyperparathyroidism as a risk factor for graft dysfunction in recipients at low risk requires reevaluation. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Limy bile syndrome (LBS) is a condition in which the biliary tract is filled with radiodense calcium carbonate rich sludge. This rare condition can complicate the management of commonly encountered biliary conditions such as choledocholithiasis. We present a case of a male in his fifties who presented to hospital with a 12-day history of abdominal pain, nausea and jaundice. Imaging and laboratory findings demonstrated a dependent radio-dense substance within the biliary system as well as an obstructing calculus at the duodenal ampulla. Management with endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography alone was insufficient and further surgical management was required. With no clear published guidelines on LBS and associated cholelithiasis, management is variable. We present this case as an addition to the literature on the management of choledocholithiasis complicated by LBS. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Acute abdominal pain in paediatric patients is a common presentation to the Emergency Department (ED). The COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on the health care sector leading to a decline in hospital attendance. Aims: We compare the burden of paediatric abdominal pain 1 year before and after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in an Irish ED. Methods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted in a tertiary hospital. Ethical approval was obtained. Data was collected from January 1 to June 30, 2019, and 2021. Patients’ charts were accessed using Therefore® software. Key variables were extracted and summarised in Microsoft Excel tables. Univariate and multivariate data analysis were conducted in SPSS® software. Results: Six hundred sixty-one (2019) and 479 (2021) patient records were evaluated. There was a 28% reduction in case presentations during pandemic months. Age group, sex and attending discipline were similar for both years. Rates of imaging were significantly higher in 2021 (22.5% vs. 10.6%). Overall admission rate was higher in 2021 (37% vs. 25%, p < 0.001). Viral gastroenteritis decreased (13%) and non-specific diagnosis increased (46%) in 2021. Fewer children re-presented in 2021 (13%). Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic had an impact on the presentation, investigations and admission rates of abdominal pain in the ED. Our study highlights the need for increased awareness of severe abdominal pain signs and symptoms in paediatric patients and importance for diagnostic accuracy. Improving patient flow through the ED and having clear guidelines for staff and parents can optimise clinical practice and improve patient outcomes. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Magnesium is essential for the functioning and release of parathyroid hormone. Therefore, its deficiency can present as functional hypoparathyroidism. This case report describes a rare inherited disorder called congenital hypomagnesaemia with secondary hypocalcaemia due to TRPM6 gene mutation. This disease clinically and biochemically mimics hypoparathyroidism. However, unlike hypoparathyroidism, it can be treated only by long-term oral magnesium supplements. The patient presented to us with recurrent hypocalcaemic convulsions. The laboratory picture in each admission was similar to that of hypoparathyroidism. However, the hypocalcaemia persisted, and it was noticed to be associated with persistent hypomagnesaemia. A defect in the tubular magnesium reabsorption was postulated and a genetic analysis of the patient was done, which revealed a TRPM6 mutation causing hypomagnesaemia by excessive renal excretion of magnesium. The child responded well to oral magnesium supplements and is currently developmentally appropriate for her age and thriving well. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Hypoparathyroidism (HypoPT) is a rare endocrine disorder characterized by hypocalcemia in association with low or inappropriately normal serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels (Khan et al., Eur J Endocrinol 180(3):P1–P22, 2019a; Khan et al., J Bone Miner Res 37(12):2663–2677, 2022a, Khan et al., J Bone Miner Res 37(12):2568–2585, 2022b; Brandi et al., J Clin Endocrinol Metab 101(6):2273–2283, 2016; Bollerslev et al., Eur J Endocrinol 186(2):R33–R63, 2022; Bilezikian et al., J Clin Endocrinol Metabol 101(6):2313–2324, 2016). PTH is the main regulator calcium homeostasis, and it increases renal calcium reabsorption, increases bone resorption, and increases the formation of active vitamin D (Khan and Bilezikian, Can Med Assoc J 163(2):184–187, 2000). In the absence of PTH, there is an increase in urine calcium losses associated with an increased risk of nephrocalcinosis, nephrolithiasis, and chronic kidney disease (CKD) (Khan et al., Eur J Endocrinol 180(3):P1–P22, 2019a; Khan et al., J Bone Miner Res 37(12):2663–2677, 2022a). PTH stimulates the hydroxylation of vitamin D and the formation of 1,25 dihydroxy vitamin D which in turn enhances the absorption of calcium and phosphate in the bowel (Khan et al., Eur J Endocrinol 180(3):P1–P22, 2019a; Khan et al., J Bone Miner Res 37(12):2663–2677, 2022a; Khan and Bilezikian, Can Med Assoc J 163(2):184–187, 2000). Through those mechanisms, PTH maintains serum calcium in the normal reference range. In patients with HypoPT due to inadequate synthesis and secretion of PTH or PTH resistance, low serum calcium levels and high phosphate levels will be present. HypoPT is associated with a decrease in bone remodeling; however, its effect on bone strength still require elucidation. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Brown tumors are rare bone manifestations of primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) that may occur at different sites either as single or multiple lesions and they can easily be mistaken for malignant lesions. Neither bone site nor morphological or functional imaging are useful to drive the differential diagnosis and biopsy is often the only conclusive procedure. Case description: We report the case of a 53 years-old man referred to our outpatient clinic for severe symptomatic PHPT complicated by nephrolithiasis and osteoporosis. Neck ultrasound and computed tomography (CT) scan showed a large irregular lesion posterior to the lower pole of the right thyroid lobe consistent with an enlarged parathyroid gland. Moreover, two bone lytic lesions were described at the left scapula and the contiguous 7th rib that showed an increased uptake at total bone scintigraphy. Given the clinical and biochemical picture, the features of the parathyroid lesion and the presence of bone lytic lesions, the suspicion of metastatic parathyroid carcinoma (PC) was raised. However, a CT-guided biopsy performed on the left scapula revealed a brown tumor. The patient underwent en-bloc resection of the right inferior parathyroid grand with the ipsilateral thyroid gland lobe. Histopathology confirmed the diagnosis of PC. Post-surgical biochemical evaluations showed that the patient was cured. A repeated total body CT scan revealed an osteoblastic appearance of the bone lesions ascribed to the partial regression of the brown tumors following surgery. Conclusions: The implication of a diagnosis of brown tumor or bone metastasis is widely different; in fact, the first tends to regress with the surgical treatment of PHPT, whereas the latter has limited cure option and negatively affects the prognosis of patients. Therefore, although brown tumors are extremely rarer than in the past, they must always be taken into consideration in the presence of bone lesions, even in cases of high suspicion of malignancy, to avoid unnecessary and harmful surgical interventions. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Obstructive urolithiasis is a fatal disorder affecting young male buffalo calves. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy of Walpole’s solution in dissolution of urethral calculi in buffalo calves with ruptured bladder in comparison to ammonium chloride. Therefore, twenty male buffalo calves aged 4–7 months admitted to the Clinic of Department of Surgery, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Zagazig University then diagnosed as obstructive urolithiasis with bladder rupture based on clinical, ultrasonographic, haematological and biochemical examinations. Ten apparently healthy calves with the same age were used as a control group. The affected animals were surgically treated with tube cystostomy technique and divided into two groups; Group I (n=10): orally administered ammonium chloride 200mg/kg and Group II (n=10): Local introducing of Walpole’s solution 100mL/animal. The time of resuming normal urination and urine pH intraoperatively and after recovery was measured. In Group I, 30%, 50% and 20% of animals resumed their normal urination within 3, 7 and 14 days postoperatively respectively meanwhile in Group II, 70% and 30% of animals resumed urination within 3 and 5 days postoperatively, respectively. The urine pH at the day of operation was 8.1±0.47. The observed calculis were triple phosphate crystals (n=16) and calcium carbonate calculi (n=4). After recovery, nonsignificant lower pH of urine in Group II (5.4±0.2) than Group I (6.7±0.14) was recorded. Consequently, in conclusion, Walpole’s solution had more efficacy to dissolute urethral calculi than ammonium chloride in buffalo calves treated with tube cystostomy. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Calcium is so essential for normal cellular functions that evolution has narrowed the tolerated range for extracellular ionized calcium and developed a complex system to regulate and maintain calcium levels, as well as bone mineralization, with very few redundant mechanisms. Therefore, discovery of hypo/hypercalcemia always reflects a pathological process challenging the fine balance of calcium absorption, PTH secretion and action, vitamin D production and action, cellular compartmentalization of calcium ions, and renal function. In children, normal growth and bone mass accruals require such a large amount of mineral that determinants of blood calcium level are tightly controlled to ensure normal skeletal growth. Indeed, periods of rapid growth are therefore at high risk of hypocalcemia if normal calcium handling is disturbed. Different molecular defects, prolonged severe environmental injuries, or dysregulation of organs and tissues involved in calcium balance, can all result in hypo/hypercalcemia. In this chapter, firstly, we discuss calcium homeostasis and the key hormones of calcium regulation. Then, we talk about the definition, clinical manifestation, and the main causes of hypo/hypercalcemia. Additionally, we propose the initial diagnostic workup and the treatment approach for calcium disorders. Finally, we describe the specific features of underlying diseases of hyper- and hypocalcemia. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Obstructive urolithiasis is a common condition in male sheep and goats. Calcium carbonate has been identified as the most common urolith type in hospitalised patients, but phosphatic calculi frequently predominate in fattening animals. According to current knowledge, nutrition appears to have the biggest influence on the development of the various urolith types. Phosphatic uro-liths in particular can be triggered by a high concentrate diet. The clinical signs of urethral obstructions vary greatly and can easily be overlooked or misinterpreted. Further examinations such as an ultrasound scan are necessary to confirm the suspected diag-nosis. Treatment is subsequently carried out in several steps. Firstly, the urethral process should be amputated. If this does not achieve urethral patency, temporary tube cystostomy should be performed. The survival rate following tube cystostomy has been reported as 40 to 84% in various studies and can particularly be improved by rapid onset of treatment. However, the recurrence rate is very high and the prognosis remains guarded. Clinical relevance: Obstructive urolithiasis should always be con-sidered as a differential diagnosis in male small ruminants showing a compromised clinical condition.

AB  - Introduction: Introduction: Renal stone poses a significant public health issue worldwide, particularly in Iraq’s southern region. Although urinary tract infections are more likely in the presence of renal stones, the role of bacteria in the development of common stone types remains underexplored. Objectives: This study aimed to identify bacterial species isolated from urine and stones, to determine their sensitivity to antibiotics, and also to perform a chemical analysis of stones, focusing on the most prevalent type. Patients and Methods: One hundred adult patients with renal stones admitted to the surgical department of Al-Zahrawi surgical hospital in Maysan governorate were enrolled, then urine and surgical stone cultures were gathered. Bacterial identification was conducted using 16S rDNA gene sequencing. Additionally, a qualitative chemical composition analysis of stones was conducted. Results: A total of 130 bacterial isolates were identified (comprising nine different species), Escherichia coli was the predominant bacterium in both urine and stone cultures (41 and 20 isolates respectively), followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (15 and 9, respectively) and Proteus mirabilis (11 and 8 respectively). Most isolates showed high sensitivity to imipenem and amikacin (80% and 71.5%, respectively; P<0.01), while sensitivity to tetracycline, sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, nitrofurantoin, and ampicillin was notably lower (30.7%, 24.9%, 21.5% and 12.3% respectively). The incidence of renal stones was more frequent in males (64%), particularly among patients aged 31-40 years (60%), with a significant difference at P ≤ 0.05. Additionally, calcium oxalate was the most common biochemical composition of stones (51%), followed by calcium phosphate and uric acid (19% and 15% respectively), since magnesium-ammonium phosphate, calcium carbonate, and cystine were less common (9%, 4%, and 2%, respectively). There was also a significant relationship between bacterial urinary tract infection and the presence of renal stones. Conclusion: The most common bacteria isolated from adult patients with renal stones in Maysan governorate were Escherichia coli, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis. Calcium oxalate stones were most frequent, followed by uric acid. The infection rate between urinary tract infection and renal stones was 65% and this is considered significant. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Parathyroid carcinoma (PC) is extremely rare in children and adolescent. PC is more often sporadic, but also it could be associated with germline mutations. The clinical features of primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) are nonspecific in children and adolescent, which delays the diagnosis for years. This case of PC in a pediatric patient, caused by germline heterozygous pathogenic variant in exon 1 of the CDC73 gene (c.70 G > T, p. Glu24Ter) is the first to be reported in Russia. Due to the rarity of pediatric parathyroid malignancy, the diagnosis of this endocrine neoplasm remains a challenge. The main difficulties that we faced in the management of the patient were the morphological confirmation of diagnosis, multiple surgical interventions, and disseminated PC metastases. We describe a 13-year-old girl with delayed diagnosis of PC and subsequent local recurrence after several surgeries, who underwent specific radiation therapy that allowed controlling hypercalcemia. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - In vitro studies of stone-related crystals and crystals-cell interactions have been extensively done to investigate cellular, molecular and pathogenic mechanisms leading to renal calculi. Effective preparation of various types of stone-related crystals is thus crucial for such studies. Nevertheless, various protocols for preparing these stone-related crystals were scatteredly reported without comparative analysis of their efficacies and yields. Herein, we systematically compared our protocols (with the suffix “-Si”) for preparing calcium oxalate (CaOx) monohydrate (COM), CaOx dihydrate (COD), magnesium ammonium phosphate (struvite), uric acid (UA), calcium phosphate dihydrate (brushite), hydroxyapatite (HAP), and calcium carbonate (CaCO<inf>3</inf>) crystals with other protocols published previously. The morphological evaluation revealed that our protocols provided the most homogeneous and most typical monoclinic prismatic, bipyramidal, coffin lid and rectangle shapes of COM, COD, struvite and UA crystals, respectively. There were comparable morphological results for brushite, HAP and CaCO<inf>3</inf> crystals generated by different protocols. Our protocols provided the greatest yield for generating brushite crystals but with lower yields for others. Chemical analysis by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy revealed comparable results among different protocols to generate each crystal type. In summary, all these protocols can be used to generate each crystal type. But our protocols offer the best quality, in terms of homogeneity and typical shape, for generating COM, COD, struvite and UA crystals. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Iron deficiency anemia and pre-Anemic iron deficiency are the most frequent pathologies. The first line of treatment involves oral iron supplementation. The simplest, least expensive, and most frequently prescribed drug is ferrous sulfate, while other ferrous salts and ferric complexes with polysaccharides or succinylated milk proteins are also widely used. In recent years, novel iron formulations have been developed, such as the lipophilic iron donor ferric maltol, or nanoparticle encapsulated sucrosomial® iron. Oral iron supplementation is usually efficacious in correcting iron deficiency anemia and replenishing iron stores but causes gastrointestinal side effects that reduce compliance. When oral iron supplementation is contraindicated, intravenous iron therapy can rapidly achieve therapeutic targets without gastrointestinal complications. Herein, we critically review literature on relative efficacy and tolerability of currently available oral iron supplements, and summarize recent data on optimal dosage and frequency. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Effective prevention of recurrent kidney stone disease requires the understanding of the mechanisms of its formation. Numerous in vivo observations have demonstrated that a large number of pathological calcium oxalate kidney stones develop on an apatitic calcium phosphate deposit, known as Randall's plaque. In an attempt to understand the role of the inorganic hydroxyapatite phase in the formation and habits of calcium oxalates, we confined their growth under dynamic physicochemical and flow conditions in a reversible microfluidic channel coated with hydroxyapatite. Using multi-scale characterization techniques including scanning electron and Raman microscopy, we showed the successful formation of carbonated hydroxyapatite as found in Randall's plaque. This was possible due to a new two-step flow seed-mediated growth strategy which allowed us to coat the channel with carbonated hydroxyapatite. Precipitation of calcium oxalates under laminar flow from supersaturated solutions of oxalate and calcium ions showed that the formation of crystals is a substrate and time dependent complex process where diffusion of oxalate ions to the surface of carbonated hydroxyapatite and the solubility of the latter are among the most important steps for the formation of calcium oxalate crystals. Indeed when an oxalate solution was flushed for 24 h, dissolution of the apatite layer and formation of calcium carbonate calcite crystals occurred which seems to promote calcium oxalate crystal formation. Such a growth route has never been observed in vivo in the context of kidney stones. Under our experimental conditions, our results do not show any direct promoting role of carbonated hydroxyapatite in the formation of calcium oxalate crystals, consolidating therefore the important role that macromolecules can play in the process of nucleation and growth of calcium oxalate crystals on Randall's plaque. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Introduction: Apatite rheumatism (AR), chondrocalcinosis (Ch-C), and primary synovial chondromatosis (prSynCh) are regarded as distinct clinical entities. The introduction of the non-staining technique by Bély and Apáthy (2013) opened a new era in the microscopic diagnosis of crystal induced diseases, allowing the analysis of MSU (monosodium urate monohydrate) HA (calcium hydroxyapatite), CPPD (calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate) crystals, cholesterol, crystalline liquid lipid droplets, and other crystals in unstained sections of conventionally proceeded (aqueous formaldehyde fixed, paraffin-embedded) tissue samples. The aim of this study was to describe the characteristic histology of crystal deposits in AR, Ch-C, and prSynCh with traditional stains and histochemical reactions comparing with unstained tissue sections according to Bély and Apáthy (2013). Patients and methods: Tissue samples of 4 with apatite rheumatism (Milwaukee syndrome), 16 with chondrocalcinosis, and 20 with clinically diagnosed primary synovial chondromatosis were analyzed. Results and conclusion: Apatite rheumatism, chondrocalcinosis, and primary synovial chondromatosis are related metabolic disorders with HA and CPPD depositions. The authors assume that AR and Ch-C are different stages of the same metabolic disorder, which differ from prSynCh in amorphous mineral production, furthermore in the production of chondroid, osteoid and/or bone. prSynCh is a defective variant of HA and CPPD induced metabolic disorders with reduced mineralization capabilities, where the deficient mineralization is replaced by chondroid and/or bone formation. The non-staining technique of Bély and Apáthy proved to be a much more effective method for the demonstration of crystals in metabolic diseases than conventional stains and histochemical reactions. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper describes cases of urolithiasis in fattening pigs on two farms (A and B). Bladder rupture due to urethral obstruction with calculi was the principal finding during the necropsy of the pigs. An in-depth diagnostic examination was performed to elucidate possible pathophysiological mechanisms, namely Fourier-transform infrared spectrophotometry (FT-IR) analysis of the uroliths, blood analysis (farm A: 5 samples, farm B: 10 samples) for assessing concentrations of minerals, the bone resorption marker cross-linked C-telopeptide of type 1 collagen (CTX), parathyroid hormone (PTH), and vitamin D components, biochemical urinalysis (farm A: 5 samples, farm B: 7 samples), microscopic examination of urinary sediment (Farms A and B: 7 samples each), mineral composition of the feed, and analysis of the drinking water. Calcium carbonate was the main component found in stones from both farms, and calcium carbonate and struvite were the main components found in crystals from farms A and B, respectively. On farm A, urinary calcium excretion and urinary pH were high; on farm B, urinary phosphorus was high and urinary calcium was low with a normal urinary pH. The mineral compositions of the feed and drinking water were similar on both farms and could therefore not explain the difference between the two farms. Disturbances in calcium and phosphorus absorption and homeostasis might have been involved in these problems. Further research should focus on the calcium, phosphorus, and vitamin D levels in the feed and take into account other factors, such as the absorption and excretion of minerals due to gut and urinary microbiota. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Purpose of the review: This article seeks to identify common kidney problems often seen in the pediatrician’s office and associated nutritional management. Although many of these problems should be referred to a pediatric nephrology team where, ideally, a trained pediatric renal dietitian can provide intense dietary management and counseling, it is often necessary for initial information to come from the pediatrician. This review seeks to provide basic nutrition information a pediatrician can use to initially guide their patients to improve medical management. Recent findings: Hypertension is rapidly increasing, likely related to poor quality seen in western diets. A multi-layered approach that includes physical activity, DASH diet guidelines, and limiting sodium has been shown to be effective. For children with kidney stones, the mechanisms for best management are demonstrated herein, which does not include avoidance of calcium, despite a large portion of many stones being comprised of calcium. Mitigation of sodium and adequate fluid intake are the key. For nephrotic syndrome, simple tools to manage sodium intake can be helpful, and attention to calcium and vitamin D intake may be more important than originally thought. Summary: Knowledge of nutrition recommendations for the plethora of kidney issues that come through the office of the general pediatrician can be helpful to ensure that youth are on the best path for their dietary management. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Parathyroid carcinoma (PC) is an uncommon cause of primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) and particularly rare in the mediastinum. Herein, we present a case of mediastinal PC and conduct a related literature review. Case presentation: We described a case of a 50-year-old female patient with PHPT due to mediastinal PC. She was initially admitted to a local hospital in her hometown with hypercalcemia and high blood concentrations of PTH (parathyroid hormone). The patient underwent neck parathyroidectomy and pathological examination suggested parathyroid adenoma. Although the overproduction of serum calcium and PTH declined after the surgery, calcium and PTH increased again one month later, so the patient was transferred to our hospital. A 99mTc-sestamibi scan revealed an ectopic finding in the mediastinum, which was also indicated on the CT image. After removing the mediastinal mass, the metabolism of calcium and PTH quickly reverted to normal and the pathologic features of the mass were consistent with PC. By reviewing the related literature, we noticed that only scattered reports were published before 1982, and those were not included in the present review due to their differences with current radiological examination and treatment methods. After excluding outdated studies, we summarized and analyzed 20 reports of isolated mediastinal PC and concluded that. Parathyroidectomy remains the only curative treatment for the disease. Furthermore, the success of treatment directly depends on accurate preoperative localization. Conclusion: With this study, we emphasize the importance of accurate preoperative diagnosis of mediastinal PC and improve clinicians’ understanding of the disease. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Preoperative diagnosis of urinary infection stones is difficult, and accurate detection of stone composition can only be performed ex vivo. To provide guidance for better perioperative management and postoperative prevention of infection stones, we developed a machine learning model for preoperative identification of infection stones in vivo. The clinical data of patients with urolithiasis who underwent surgery in our hospital from January 2011 to December 2015 and January 2017 to December 2021 were retrospectively analyzed. A total of 2565 patients were included in the study, and 1168 eligible patients with urinary calculi were randomly divided into training set (70%) and test set (30%). Five machine learning algorithms (Support Vector Machine (SVM), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest Classifier (RFC), and Adaptive Boost (AdaBoost)) and 14 preoperative variables were used to construct the prediction model. The performance measure was the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of the validation set. The importance of 14 features in each prediction model for predicting infection stones was analyzed. A total of 89 patients (5.34%) with infection stones were included in the validation set. All the five prediction models showed strong discrimination in the validation set (AUC: 0.689–0.772). AdaBoost model was selected as the final model (AUC: 0.772(95% confidence interval, 0.657–0.887); Sensitivity: 0.522; Specificity: 0.902), UC positivity, and urine pH value were two important predictors of infection stones. We developed a predictive model through machine learning that can quickly identify infection stones in vivo with good predictive performance. It can be used for risk assessment and decision support of infection stones, optimize the disease management of urinary calculi and improve the prognosis of patients. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - We report a 15-year-old Chinese girl who presented with intermittent seizure episodes and had been misdiagnosed as having idiopathic epilepsy 5 years previously. Laboratory testing revealed hypocalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, and a high parathyroid hormone (PTH) concentration. She was subsequently shown to have pseudohypoparathyroidism type Ib (PHPIb) based on the results of methylation analysis of the GNAS gene, which showed a loss of methylation of the differentially methylated regions (DMR) of GNAS-AS1, GNAS-XL, and GNAS-A/B; and a gain of methylation of the DMR of the GNAS-NESP55 region. We adjusted the patient’s medication by prescribing calcium and calcitriol supplements, and gradually reduced the doses of antiepileptic drugs, until they had been completely discontinued. As a result, the patient did not experience any further seizures or epileptiform symptoms; and had normal plasma calcium, phosphorus, and 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations and 24-hour urinary calcium excretion. In addition, her PTH concentration gradually normalized over 12 months, and no urinary stones were found on ultrasonographic examination. In conclusion, the clinical presentation of PHP is complex, and the condition is often misdiagnosed. The diagnosis and follow-up of the present patient have provide valuable insights that should contribute to informed clinical decision-making and the implementation of appropriate treatment strategies. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Biomineralization describes the process of mineral precipitation from soluble precursors by living organisms. It is sometimes associated with single bacterial cells, for example, the formation of magnetosomes by magnetotactic bacteria, as well as with groups of bacterial cells that form biofilms and precipitate calcium carbonate (CaCO<inf>3</inf>). Recently, there has been growing evidence connecting isolated bacteria and bacterial biofilms with calcium oxalate (CaOx) formation in kidney stones. Therefore, in this study, we examined the effect of a principal exopolysaccharide bacterial biofilm component on the crystallization of CaOx. We observed that the exopolysaccharide, identified as levan, induced the formation of both octahedral CaOx dihydrate (COD, Weddellite) and pancake-like CaOx monohydrate crystals (COM, Whewellite) in a concentration-dependent manner. A combined analysis of the CaOx crystals that formed in the presence of levan, using scanning electron microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction, indicated that levan affects both the nucleation and the growth of CaOx and that its interaction with CaOx is stereospecific. Given the emerging relation between bacterial biofilms and kidney stones, which are prevalent within approximately 12% of the worldwide population, it is important to decipher the effect of biofilm extracellular polymers on the formation of CaOx crystals as it may assist in the development of future treatments to interfere with kidney stone formation. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Spatial localizing of skeletal proteins in biogenic minerals remains a challenge in biomineralization research. To address this goal, we developed a novel in situ mapping technique based on molecular recognition measurements via atomic force microscopy (AFM), which requires three steps: (1) the development and purification of a polyclonal antibody elicited against the target protein, (2) its covalent coupling to a silicon nitride AFM tip ('functionalization'), and (3) scanning of an appropriately prepared biomineral surface. We applied this approach to a soluble shell protein - accripin11 - recently identified as a major component of the calcitic prisms of the fan mussel Pinna nobilis [1]. Multiple tests reveal that accripin11 is evenly distributed at the surface of the prisms and also present in the organic sheaths surrounding the calcitic prisms, indicating that this protein is both intra- and inter-crystalline. We observed that the adhesion force in transverse sections is about twice higher than in longitudinal sections, suggesting that accripin11 may exhibit preferred orientation in the biomineral. To our knowledge, this is the first time that a protein is localized by molecular recognition atomic force microscopy with antibody-functionalized tips in a biogenic mineral. The 'pros' and 'cons' of this methodology are discussed in comparison with more 'classical' approaches like immunogold. This technique, which leaves the surface to analyze clean, might prove useful for clinical tests on non-pathological (bone, teeth) or pathological (kidney stone) biomineralizations. Studies using implants with protein-doped calcium phosphate coating can also benefit from this technology. Statement of significance: Our paper deals with an unconventional technical approach for localizing proteins that are occluded in biominerals. This technique relies on the use of molecular recognition atomic force microscopy with antibody-functionalized tips. Although such approach has been employed in other system, this is the very first time that it is developed for biominerals. In comparison to more classical approaches (such as immunogold), AFM microscopy with antibody-functionalized tips allows higher magnification and keeps the scanned surface clean for other biophysical characterizations. Our method has a general scope as it can be applied in human health, for non-pathological (bone, teeth) and pathological (kidney stone) biomineralizations as well as for bone implants coated with protein-doped calcium phosphate. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - An 18-year-old Hanoverian Warmblood gelding was presented with a history of acute haematuria. On rectal examination, a severely dilated right ureter with a concrement was palpated. Transabdominal sonography raised the suspicion of right kidney enlargement and loss of normal architecture. An exploratory laparoscopy was performed to evaluate the diagnostic findings. The tentative plan was to perform a laparoscopic ureterolith removal and a hand-Assisted right nephrectomy, as high ureterolith recurrence rates are reported without nephrectomy. Right hand-Assisted laparoscopic nephrectomy was performed and confirmed nephrolithiasis. Since the ureteral stone could not be mobilised, it was left in situ. Post-operative pain management proved a major challenge in this case, and was initially insufficient in spite of a multi-modal approach. Applied pain management techniques as used in human donor nephrectomy require further investigation for potential future use in equine patients. The gelding resumed his activity as a leisure horse six weeks after surgery, but was euthanized three months after surgery due to an unrelated cause. Nephrectomy without ureterolith removal provided a successful solution for this case of severe kidney disease. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Context: Patients with primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) can present with variable signs, symptoms, and end-organ effects. Clinical practice guidelines influence referral for consideration of parathyroidectomy. Objective: This study compared the demographic, biochemical, and symptom profile and examine indications for surgery in patients older than 50 years who underwent parathyroidectomy to determine how changes to current guidelines may affect recommendations for parathyroidectomy. Methods: A retrospective review was conducted of patients age 50 years or older who underwent initial parathyroidectomy for sporadic PHPT from 2012 to 2020. Patients were classified by indications for surgery per guideline criteria (classic, asymptomatic, and no criteria met) and age group (AG): 50 to 59 years; 60 to 69 years; 70 years or older. Patients were treated at a high-volume tertiary medical center by endocrine surgeons. Results: Of 1182 patients, 367 (31%) classic and 660 (56%) asymptomatic patients met the criteria for surgery. The most common indications for surgery were extent of hypercalcemia (51%), osteoporosis (28%), and nephrolithiasis (27%). Of the 155 (13%) patients who did not meet the criteria, neurocognitive symptoms (AG1: 88% vs AG2: 81% vs AG3: 70%; P=.14) and osteopenia (AG1: 53% vs AG2: 68% vs AG3: 68%; P=.43) were frequently observed regardless of patient age. If the age threshold of younger than 50 years was expanded to 60, 65, or 70 years, an additional 61 (5%), 99 (8%), and 124 (10%) patients in the entire cohort would have met the guideline criteria for surgery, respectively. Conclusion: Expanding current guidelines for PHPT to include a broader age range, osteopenia, and neurocognitive symptoms may allow for earlier surgical referral and evaluation for definitive treatment. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Introduction: In most cases of parathyroid adenoma (PA), it is not palpable and physical examination shows no remarkable findings. Hence diagnosis requires an index of suspicion. The current paper describes four cases of severe hypercalcemia secondary to PA. Presentation of cases: Case 1 - 29 years old Sudanese female with history of nausea/vomiting, fatigue, loss of appetite and bone aches. She had large palpable left lower neck swelling, and high calcium and PTH. Ultrasound (US) neck and SPECT/CT scan after sestamibi injection showed left inferior PA. Case 2–73 years old Sudanese male referred with history of abdominal pain and flatulence. He had severely high calcium, elevated parathormone (PTH), and high 24-hour urine calcium. US and SPECT/CT showed a left inferior PA. Case 3–54 years old Bangladeshi male, referred with history of renal colic/urolithiasis. Laboratory results showed severely high calcium and PTH levels. US and SPECT/CT scan showed right inferior PA. Case 4–35 years old Tunisian female, 12 weeks pregnant, referred with recurrent nausea and vomiting of increasing frequency from the second week of pregnancy. Laboratory tests revealed severe hypercalcemia and high PTH. US showed two parathyroid lesions. Discussion: The patients were admitted as emergency cases and investigations diagnosed severe hypercalcemia secondary to PA. All patients underwent neck exploration and PA excision. Histology confirmed PA. The four cases were swiftly assessed and treated before progressing into the more serious hypercalcemic crisis which can lead to grave consequences, particularly in the case of the pregnant female. All patients recovered with no complications and were clinically well with normal calcium level on follow up. Conclusion: Severe hypercalcemia must be swiftly and thoroughly assessed to prevent the more serious hypercalcemic crisis. Clinicians need to be suspicious of parathyroid adenoma as a probable cause. Severe hypercalcemia is often accompanied with vomiting, and in pregnant females, this could be mistaken for hyperemesis gravidarum. Excision of the parathyroid adenoma treats the condition and follow up of serum calcium and PTH confirms the favorable outcome of surgery. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Near-infrared activated nanomaterials have been reported for biomedical applications ranging from photothermal tumor destruction to biofilm eradication and energy-gated drug delivery. However, the focus so far has been on soft tissues, and little is known about energy delivery to hard tissues, which have thousand-fold higher mechanical strength. We present photonic lithotripsy with carbon and gold nanomaterials for fragmenting human kidney stones. The efficacy of stone comminution is dependent on the size and photonic properties of the nanomaterials. Surface restructuring and decomposition of calcium oxalate to calcium carbonate support the contribution of photothermal energy to stone failure. Photonic lithotripsy has several advantages over current laser lithotripsy, including low operating power, noncontact laser operation (distances of at least 10 mm), and ability to break all common stones. Our observations can inspire the development of rapid, minimally invasive techniques for kidney stone treatment and extrapolate to other hard tissues such as enamel and bone. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - A potential complication of pharmacotherapy for a given patient is the possibility of various side effects of drugs, which are manifested in many ways and constitute iatrogenic causes of diseases. Among the systemic side effects of drugs, there are also those involving the urinary tract, although these are less reported in the literature. The use of numerous drugs—especially of anticholinergics or drugs with anticholinergic potential, opioid analgesics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, antidepressants, first-generation antipsychotics (classic neuroleptics) and selected cardiovascular drugs (beta-blockers, thiazides potassium-sparing diuretics, statins), as well as others—may increase the risk of developing urological disorders, such as urinary retention or incontinence, urinary tract infections, urolithiasis, erectile dysfunction in men and retroperitoneal fibrosis. The purpose of this paper is to characterise the abovementioned drug-induced disorders of the lower urinary tract on the basis of a non-systematic literature review. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - A 4-year-old gelding was referred to the clinic with a history of haematuria and stranguria after exercise. Transrectal examination and endoscopy of the urinary bladder revealed the presence of a cystolith. The patient underwent general anaesthesia to remove the bladder stone through a para-inguinal approach. A layer of calcium carbonate was found covering a foreign body acting as the nidus of the urolith. The foreign body was a 4 × 3 cm rubber tie of unknown origin. Surgery and recovery were uneventful without recurrence of clinical signs for up to 2 years after surgery. This is the first published report describing a laparocystotomy for removal of a cystolith secondary to an intravesical foreign body in a gelding. Migration of a foreign body into the urinary bladder, although very uncommon, is possible. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Radish is a vegetable high in nutritional and phytochemical contents that are beneficial to the human body, especially for managing kidney stone disease. However, it is less consumed as compared to other vegetables due to its pungent flavour and odour. Therefore, the objective of the present work was to formulate a radish effervescent tablet to enhance the palatability of the vegetable. The radish effervescent tablet was formulated by using Simplex Lattice Mixture Design where the percentages of sucralose and strawberry flavour were chosen as the factors. Five formulations were generated, and sensory acceptance test was conducted on them. Next, the halalan toyyiban principle compliance was evaluated based on the Halal Control Points (HCPs), toxicity assay (brine shrimp lethality assay), anti-urolithiatic properties (turbidimetric assay), and nutritional composition (energy, total protein, total fat, total carbohydrate, and total sugar). Formulation 5 (F5) with 20% citric acid, 12% sodium bicarbonate, 58% radish powder, 2.5% sucralose, and 7.5% strawberry flavour was selected as the most acceptable formulation (p < 0.05). For the halalan toyyiban principle compliance, F5 was evaluated, and it complied with the halalan toyyiban principles. It is halal, non-toxic, and safe for consumption as the LC<inf>50</inf> was greater than 1,000 μg/mL (2,223.31 μg/mL) for toxicity test, and exhibited significant potential as an anti-urolithiatic agent (88.13% inhibition). In the future, prototype development of radish effervescent tablet with potential anti-urolithiatic and fast-dissolving properties can be carried out. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Urolithiasis is an uncommon disorder reported in horses. Calculi located in the kidneys and ureters are often underdiagnosed. Associated clinical signs include weight loss, anorexia, haematuria, dysuria, colic and polyuria/polydipsia. A 26-year-old Thoroughbred gelding was referred for evaluation of an acute colic episode of 5-hour duration. Haematologic analysis revealed increased serum creatine kinase and creatinine concentrations. Abdominocentesis yielded serosanguineous, mildly cloudy fluid with a lactate of 9.6 mmol/L (<2 mmol/L). Exploratory laparotomy was recommended. Surgical intervention was declined, and the horse was humanely euthanased. Limited postmortem evaluation was performed. A 3.633 kg nephrolith measuring 23.6 × 16.2 × 8.9 cm was completely effacing the left kidney. Crystallography and infrared spectroscopy (attenuated total reflection and Fourier transform infrared) revealed a 100% calcium carbonate nephrolith. Carbonate calcium calculi are the most common subtype in horses. Nephrolithiasis should be considered as a differential diagnosis for colic and haematologic evidence of azotaemia in horses. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is classically characterized by hypercalcemia with elevated or inappropriately normal parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels. Elevated PTH levels in the presence of normal calcium levels are not infrequently found during the evaluation of metabolic bone disorders or kidney stone disease. This can be caused by secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) or normocalcemic primary hyperparathyroidism (NPHPT). NPHPT is due to autonomous parathyroid function whereas SHPT is caused by a physiologic stimulation to PTH secretion. Many medical conditions and medications can contribute to SHPT, and differentiation between SHPT and NPHPT may be difficult. Cases are presented to illustrate examples. In this paper, we review the distinction between SHPT and NPHPT as well as end organ effects of NPHPT and outcomes of surgery in NPHPT. We suggest that the diagnosis of NPHPT be made only after careful exclusion of causes of SHPT and consideration of medications that can increase PTH secretion. Further, we advise a conservative approach to surgery in NPHPT. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Hypoparathyroidism (hypoPT) is a relatively rare endocrine disease, mainly due to thyroid surgery. The classical supplementation with calcium and active vitamin D may represent a challenge to the clinician. Objective: To describe the level of biochemical control in patients with chronic hypoPT and to look for differences between postsurgical and non-surgical cases referred between 2006 and 2020. Materials and Methods: This was a retrospective cross-sectional study with data review from the database of a tertiary endocrine clinic from the last 15 years. Cases with hypocalcemia not related to PTH were excluded. The patients' medical history was reviewed as well as concomitant diseases and medications. Serum calcium (total, albumin-corrected and ionized; sCa, corrCa, iCa+) and phosphates (P), magnesium, creatinine, alkaline phosphatase together with 24hr urinary calcium and phosphate were measured. The intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) was determined by electro-hemi-luminescence (Elecsys, Roche Diagnostics). Thyroid and abdominal ultrasound (US) were both performed. Results: Seventy-eight patients met the study criteria-69 were females. Most of them were between 30 and 60 years (mean age 50.6 ± 14.5 years). Albumin-corrected calcium was in target in 20.5% of the patients, ionized calcium-in 36.5%, serum phosphate-in 46.3%, serum magnesium-in 87.9%. When all four parameters were taken together, less than 20% were in target. Hypercalciuria was registered in 11.8%, while 57.1% of the patients had nephrolithiasis and 27.3% had CKD grade 3-4. Thus, a high proportion of patients with kidney involvement was identified. Calcium carbonate and calcitriol were the preferred replacement choices. Comparing patients with post-surgical and non-surgical hypoPT significant differences were found only for age, total serum calcium, serum magnesium and TSH. Conclusion: Our study is the first of its kind in our country during the last two decades describing the contemporary clinical and biochemical picture of chronic hypoPT in patients referred for specialized care. Low supplementation doses leading to hypocalcemia and hyperphosphatemia were a common finding. Low patient's adherence may be just one possible explanation. Non-surgical cases tend to have even lower calcium and magnesium levels. The patients, their families and treating physicians should be better informed about up-To-date management of chronic hypoPT and the possible impact of suboptimal treatment on morbidity and mortality of the affected subjects. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Individuals with cancer experience a host of symptoms, especially when the malignancy is advanced. Pain occurs from the cancer itself or related treatments. Undertreated pain contributes to patient suffering and lack of engagement in cancer-directed therapies. Adequate pain management includes thorough assessment; treatment by radiotherapists or anesthesia pain specialists; anti-inflammatory medications, oral or intravenous opioid analgesics, and topical agents; and attention to the emotional and functional effects of pain, which may involve social workers, psychologists, speech therapists, nutritionists, physiatrists and palliative medicine providers. This review discusses typical pain syndromes arising in cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy and provides concrete recommendations for pain assessment and pharmacologic treatment. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The most appropriate surgical procedure for tertiary hyperparathyroidism is still controversial. Medical management may be considered in those patients with failed previous surgical intervention. There are limited medical options for tertiary hyperparathyroidism with renal dysfunction. The monoclonal antibody denosumab has been used in patients with osteoporosis and hypercalcemia of malignancy. We report a case of medically refractory hypercalcemia caused by tertiary hyperparathyroidism treated with denosumab. A 46-year-old female was on hemodialysis for 10 years. She was diagnosed with tertiary hyperparathyroidism due to hypercalcemia with a high level of intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH, 1411 pg/ml). After right parathyroidectomy 6 weeks, her serum calcium remained persistently elevated (Ca, 3.17 mmoL/L). Denosumab (60 mg) was administered subcutaneously, and her serum calcium quickly decreased (from 3.43 to 2.04 mmoL/L within 8 days) and was slightly elevated (Ca, 2.8 mmoL/L) 3 months later. We conclude that denosumab has a significant effect on the reduction of serum calcium for tertiary hyperparathyroidism patients. The long-term treatment effect and safety warrant more studies in the future. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Parathyroid cancer is a rare, clinically aggressive malignancy with a prevalence of approximately 0.005% relative to all carcinoma cases and 1–5% among patients with primary hyperparathyroidism. Prognosis largely depends on the extent of the primary surgery. Non-radical surgical treatment increases the risk of local and distant metastases of the parathyroid cancer associated with limited treatment options. The combination of thyroid and parathyroid disorders has been described rather well for the general population; however, cases of parathyroid and thyroid carcinoma in the same patient are extremely rare (1 case per 3000 patients with parathyroid disorders). We present a rare clinical case of combination of parathyroid and thyroid cancers with metastases of both tumors to the neck lymph nodes in a woman with a mutation in the MEN1 gene (NM_130799.2): c.658T > C p.Trp220Arg (W220R), who has been exposed to radiation for 20 years before diagnosis of thyroid cancer and received renal replacement therapy with long-term hemodialysis before the diagnosis of parathyroid cancer. The patient underwent several surgeries because of metastases of the parathyroid cancer in the neck lymph nodes. Surgeons used intraoperative navigation methods (single-channel gamma detection probe, Gamma Probe 2, and fluorescence angiography with indocyanine green (ICG)) to clarify the volume of surgery. Currently, the patient is still in laboratory remission, despite the structural recurrence of tumors. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Kidney stones are a highly prevalent disease worldwide. Additionally, both environmental and occupational exposure to Pb and Cd continue to be prevalent globally and can result in renal toxicity. The objective of this study was to examine the potential presence of Pb and Cd in kidney stones, and to assess for correlation with demographic factors including smoking, gender, age, and kidney stone matrix composition. Methods: Patient kidney stones (n = 96) were analyzed using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy to identify the stone constituents. Cd and Pb concentrations (μg/g) were determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Cd and Pb concentrations were correlated using bivariable and multivariable statistical analysis with demographic factors (age, gender, smoking status), and kidney stone composition. Results: Kidney stone Cd (median 0.092 μg/g, range 0.014 to 2.46) and Pb concentrations (median 0.95 μg/g, range 0.060 to 15.4) were moderately correlated (r = 0.56, P < 0.0001). Cd concentrations were positively associated with patient history of smoking, patient age, and calcium oxalate monohydrate levels while negatively associated with struvite and uric acid/uric acid dihydrate. Pb concentrations were positively associated with females and apatite levels while negatively associated with uric acid/uric acid dihydrate. After holding constant other stone type composition levels, smoking status, and age, both Pb and Cd were positively associated with apatite and negatively associated with uric acid/uric acid dihydrate, struvite, and calcium carbonate. Conclusions: Cd and Pb kidney stone concentrations are associated with specific kidney stone types. Cd and Pb kidney stone concentrations are both associated with smoking. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Obstructive urolithiasis is common in male small ruminants. Struvite is often assumed the most frequent urolith type, but urolith analyses are rarely published, especially in Europe. Prognostic factors for short-and long-term outcomes following treatment are also rarely studied. Ninety urolith samples from small ruminants presented to a veterinary hospital were examined by infrared spectroscopy, and factors potentially associated with urolith type were statistically analysed. Treatment outcomes for 148 sheep and goats with obstructive urolithiasis were additionally assessed with particular focus on potential predictors for successful tube cystostomy (n=89) and long-term outcomes. Calcium carbonate was the most frequent urolith type, followed by silica and calcium phosphate. Species, age, animal purpose, husbandry, castration status, body condition and nutrition were significantly associated with urolith type. Goats, older animals, pets, access to pasture, castration and obesity were significantly associated with the development of calcium-based uroliths, while sheep, young age, year-round housing, uncastrated animals, non-obese body condition and high concentrate diet were associated with the development of phosphatic calculi. Of the 89 animals receiving tube cysto-stomy, 36 (40.4%) could be discharged from the hospital. Positive predictors for a successful short-term outcome were timely presentation for treatment, successful orthograde urethral flushing and uncompromised general condition following surgery. The recurrence rate following initially successful treatment was however high (41.3%), and statistical analyses did not identify any significant predictors for a successful long-term outcome. In accordance with previous studies, our data indicate that obstructive urolithiasis remains a disease with a guarded prognosis. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Pregnancy-induced hypertension is one of the major causes of both maternal and fetal death. Calcium can be prescribed to prevent the development of pre-eclampsia among the population with low calcium intake. However, there are only a few research studies on the effect of calcium alone, the impact of calcium co-administrated with other medications, and the timing of prescription during pregnancy. Materials and Methods: The authors conducted a randomized, single-blind, controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of high-dose calcium carbonate (CaCO<inf>3</inf>) co-administrate with aspirin in women with moderate to high risk of developing pre-eclampsia in reducing the incidence of pre-eclampsia. All pregnant women at 12 to 28 weeks of gestation having a moderate to high risk of developing pre-eclampsia were randomly assigned to receive aspirin with CaCO<inf>3</inf> (3,750 mg/day), or aspirin with standard dose calcium carbonate (1,250 mg/day) until delivery or developed pre-eclampsia. Results: One hundred thirty women underwent randomization with 64 women in the CaCO<inf>3</inf> group and 66 women in the standard dose group. The incidence of pre-eclampsia was six cases in the high-dose group and eight cases in the controlled group (OR 0.8, 95% CI 0.3 to 2.6). The percentage of participants having adverse events related to high-dose and standard dose calcium carbonate did not differ significantly between the groups. Conclusion: The use of CaCO<inf>3</inf> at 3,750 mg/day, co-administrate with low-dose aspirin of 81 mg/day, starting at 12 to 28 weeks of gestation, resulted in a non-significantly difference in the incidence of pre-eclampsia with severe features. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Osteoporosis (OP) has been a global health concern, and calcium supplements are still an effective method to relieve the disease. In this study, we investigated the pharmaceutical properties, antiosteoporosis, and adverse effects of a novel calcium supplement named compound calcium carbonate granule (CCCG). The dissolution rate, stability of vitamin D3, and drug permeability of the calcium supplements were explored. And the osteoporosis was constructed in mice with retinoic acid (100 mg/kg/d) for 21 days, and orally treated with CCCG (0.34, 0.68, and 1.36 g/kg/d) for 36 days to evaluate the efficacy against osteoporosis and the occurrence of kidney stones. The results showed that CCCG exhibited higher dissolution rate and better vitamin D3 stability than the standard calcium carbonate granule. CCCG also displayed more absorption in Caco-2 cell model. On the other hand, CCCG alleviated the deterioration in femur microstructure and oxidative stress in the liver and kidney, and increased the expression of bone metabolic markers. CCCG also exhibited lower risk of nephrolithiasis than the commercial calcium carbonate granule. In summary, from the perspectives of both pharmaceutics and efficacy, we illustrated the profiles of an intriguing calcium supplement, which could possibly be an alternative of commonly used ones. Practical Application. Calcium carbonate is widely used to supplement calcium, primarily because of its high calcium load, low cost, and good efficacy. Now, we provided a new calcium supplement named CCCG, which was prepared by inclusion and complexation techniques. Vitamin D3 in CCCG was made into vitamin D-β-cyclodextrin inclusion complex by inclusion technology, which improved the stability of vitamin D3. And calcium carbonate was converted to a water-soluble calcium citrate complex via complexation techniques to accelerate the release of calcium ions and minimize the risk of kidney stone formation. From the perspective of both pharmaceutics and efficacy, we illustrated the profiles of an intriguing calcium supplement, which could possibly be an alternative for the supplemental and preventive treatment of osteoporosis. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Over the past few years, there have been significant advances in our understanding of hypoparathyroidism (HypoPT) in terms of its epidemiology, clinical presentation, etiology, and skeletal and renal complications. Moreover, the available treatment options for HypoPT have changed. This position statement of the Expert Group of the Polish Society of Endocrinology summarizes the current state of knowledge and provides recommendations for optimal management to assist clinicians in the diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring of HypoPT in Poland. The specific aspects of HypoPT management in children, pregnant and lactating women, and patients with chronic kidney disease are also discussed. HypoPT is a rare disorder characterized by hypocalcemia and the lack or deficiency of parathyroid hormone (PTH). Hypoparathyroidism can be associated with complications, including nephrocalcinosis, nephrolithiasis, renal insufficiency, cataract, seizures, cardiac arrhythmia, depression, and an increased risk of infection. Minimizing complications of HypoPT requires careful evaluation and close monitoring of laboratory parameters. Conventional management of HypoPT has focused on maintaining serum calcium levels using oral calcium and active vitamin D. However, this approach is limited because it does not restore normal PTH function, is often associated with inadequate biochemical control, and raises concerns as to long-term side effects. HypoPT is the only classic endocrine insufficiency that is not commonly treated with the substitution of the missing hormone. Recently, recombinant human PTH(1-84) has become available, offering hope that the use of the missing hormone in the treatment of HypoPT will help achieve better control and reduce the risk of complications. However, this treatment is currently unavailable in Poland. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The terahertz (THz) absorption properties of calcium oxalate, calcium phosphate and calcium carbonate, which are the main components of kidney stone, are investigated experimentally in the frequency bands of 0.12 THz-8 THz and 12 THz-120 THz by using the vector network analyzer (VNA), the terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) and the infrared (IR) spectrometer. The measured results have demonstrated the absorption difference with frequency. The results of VNA and THz-TDS are consistent that calcium oxalate has weaker absorption and calcium phosphate exhibits stronger absorption when frequency is below 1 THz. The absorption of calcium phosphate is higher than calcium carbonate until frequency is greater than 2 THz. The result of IR spectrometer shows that calcium oxalate has main characteristic absorption peak at 48.8 THz, calcium phosphate and calcium carbonate are 31 THz and 42.8 THz respectively. The results provide a reference and may help to the analysis and identification of kidney stone in the future. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Purpose: Excessive alkalization will increase the incidence of nephrolithiasis. Sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO<inf>3</inf>) and potassium sodium hydrogen citrate (PSHC) are commonly used drugs for urinary alkalization. We designed a trial to compare PSHC with NaHCO<inf>3</inf> in the urine alkalization for the Chinese healthy participants and to explore the effects of PSHC and NaHCO<inf>3</inf> on circadian rhythms of urine pH value. Method: This study was a prospective, crossover, randomized, controlled trial, in which a total of 34 healthy volunteers participated in two study phases and took PSHC and NaHCO<inf>3</inf> at the maintenance dose, respectively. Result: The average level of urine pH of PSHC participants in 24 h was significantly higher than that of NaHCO<inf>3</inf> (P < 0.001). The urine pH value of participants taking PSHC and NaHCO<inf>3</inf> or under physiological conditions showed significant variation in 24 h (P < 0.05) and fitted to a mathematical model (Fourier series). Under physiological conditions, the average urine pH value in the daytime was higher than that in the night, and reached the peak at about 10:00, 16:00, and 22:00. The peak of urine pH at 24 h after taking PSHC and NaHCO<inf>3</inf> was both higher than the baseline. The peak time of urine pH and the curve trend were similar, but the peak value in PSHC group was significantly higher than that in NaHCO<inf>3</inf> group. Conclusions: There was a circadian rhythm of urine pH value under physiological conditions. PSHC was more effective in urinary alkalization than NaHCO<inf>3</inf> at the current maintenance oral dose and administration time without changing the rhythm of urine pH value.

AB  - Objective: The predominant mechanism driving hyperuricemia in gout is renal uric acid underexcretion; however, the standard urate-lowering therapy (ULT) recommendation is first-line xanthine oxidase inhibitor (XOI), irrespective of the cause of hyperuricemia. This comparative effectiveness clinical trial was undertaken to compare first-line nontitrated low-dose benzbromarone (LDBen) uricosuric therapy to XOI ULT with low-dose febuxostat (LDFeb) in gout patients with renal uric acid underexcretion. Methods: We conducted a prospective, randomized, single-center, open-label trial in men with gout and renal uric acid underexcretion (defined as fractional excretion of urate <5.5% and uric acid excretion ≤600 mg/day/1.73 m2). A total of 196 participants were randomly assigned to receive LDBen 25 mg daily or LDFeb 20 mg daily for 12 weeks. All participants received daily urine alkalization with oral sodium bicarbonate. The primary end point was the rate of achieving the serum urate target of <6 mg/dl. Results: More participants in the LDBen group achieved the serum urate target than those in the LDFeb group (61% compared to 32%, P < 0.001). Rates of adverse events, including gout flares and urolithiasis, did not differ between groups, with the exception of greater transaminase elevation in the LDFeb group (4% for LDBen compared to 15% for LDFeb, P = 0.008). Conclusion: Compared to LDFeb, LDBen has superior urate-lowering efficacy and similar safety in treating relatively young and healthy patients with renal uric acid underexcretion–type gout. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Giant parathyroid adenoma is a type of parathyroid adenoma weighing > 3.5 g and having a size of more than 2 cm. Case presentation: This report describes giant primary parathyroid adenoma with reference to the literature. We report the case of a 48-year-old Persian man referred to the clinic with knee and lower back pain. He had a history of mitral valve replacement and several episodes of bilateral nephrolithiasis. After a thorough assessment, a neck mass with a possible thyroid origin was detected, but further assessment showed it was of parathyroid origin. The resected mass was 9 × 6× 4 cm and weighed 122 g, and histopathology showed a giant parathyroid adenoma. Conclusion: Giant parathyroid adenomas that weigh more than 110 g and are larger than 8 cm can lead to significant hypercalcemia. Despite giant parathyroid adenomas and high parathyroid hormone levels, a calcium crisis may not always occur in these patients, and the masses may be initially misdiagnosed as a thyroid mass. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The present study investigated whether dietary supplementation of tripotassium citrate or NaCl reduced the prevalence of calcium oxalate dihydrate (COD) uroliths in fattening pigs on a farm with a high prevalence of COD uroliths. Each group (control, TPC, NaCl) consisted of three batches of approximately 260 fattening pigs each. Performance, water intake, markers for bone resorption (CTX) and bone formation (osteocalcin) and urinalysis from samples taken at the farm and in the slaughterhouse were investigated. Performance parameters, feed and water intake, CTX and osteocalcin were not significantly different between the groups (p > 0.05). The main crystals found were struvite, COD, calcite and amorphous crystals. The prevalence of COD crystals was lower in samples from the slaughterhouse in each group. Microscopic and biochemical examination of urine showed large differences between samples from the farm and the slaughterhouse. In conclusion, there were no beneficial effects of feed supplementation with TPC or NaCl on the prevalence of COD crystals but TPC has a clear promoting influence on the development of alkaline calcite crystals. Urinalysis from samples taken at the slaughterhouse does not fully reflect the situation on the farm. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Urinary crystals are the most diverse forms of urine sediments. Reference images for typical urinary crystals are common, however, but images for interpreting atypical urinary crystals are very rare. The authors reviewed various forms and solubility tests of urine crystals to interpret atypical crystals found in clinical specimens. Methods: We reviewed textbooks on urinary crystals and articles published in PubMed. Some atypical crystals were confirmed using a solubility test. Results: The classification, shape, chemical structure, and solubility of the crystals were summarized. In the solubility test, some crystals showed different results; therefore, a new solubility test was proposed based on the literature review. We presented various types of calcium oxalates. Conclusions: These review articles will be helpful in the examination of atypical crystals found in clinical specimens. The solubility test requires additional studies to discriminate the inconsistent results between the authors. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - A 50-year-old female Asian elephant (Elephas maximus) was referred to the Kasetsart University Veterinary Teaching Hospital with histories of anuria and abdominal pain for five days. Trans-rectal ultrasonography demonstrated the presence of hyperechogenic uroliths located between the neck and trigone of the urinary bladder. Vestibuloscopy by endoscope revealed an abnormal brownish mass obstructing the internal bladder orifice. Episiotomy was performed after standing sedation with dexmedetomidine, epidural anesthesia and perineal infiltration with lidocaine. A single 1.7 kg urinary bladder urolith with 17x12x10 cm dimension was manually removed using a combination of several methods, including sphincter dilatation using lidocaine ring infiltration at the sphincter, blind sphincterotomy, rope woven basket and intraluminal inflation with gas. The episiotomy site was left open as a window for further wound cleaning and urinary bladder lavage. Signs of chronic kidney disease were detected and post-operative care was started. However, this elephant died on day 80 after the surgery. A necropsy was performed and the major finding was severe diffuse necrosis of both kidneys. Calcium carbonate was identified as the urolith’s main component. Predisposing factors for urolith formation in this case remains unclear. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Nano- and microparticles enter the body through the respiratory airways and the digestive system, or form as biominerals in the gall bladder, salivary glands, urinary bladder, kidney, or diabetic pancreas. Calcium, magnesium, and phosphate ions can precipitate from biological fluids in the presence of mucin as hybrid nanoparticles. Calcium carbonate nanocrystallites also trap mucin and are assembled into hybrid microparticles. Both mucin and calcium carbonate polymorphs (calcite, aragonite, and vaterite) are known to be components of such biominerals as gallstones which provoke inflammatory reactions. Our study was aimed at evaluation of neutrophil activation by hybrid vaterite–mucin microparticles (CCM). Vaterite microparticles (CC) and CCM were prepared under standard conditions. The diameter of CC and CCM was 3.3 ± 0.8 µm and 5.8 ± 0.7 µm, with ƺ-potentials of −1 ± 1 mV and −7 ± 1 mV, respectively. CC microparticles injured less than 2% of erythrocytes in 2 h at 1.5 mg mL−1, and no hemolysis was detected with CCM; this let us exclude direct damage of cellular membranes by microparticles. Activation of neutrophils was analyzed by luminol- and lucigenin-dependent chemiluminescence (Lum-CL and Luc-CL), by cytokine gene expression (IL-6, IL-8, IL-10) and release (IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, TNF-α), and by light microscopy of stained smears. There was a 10-fold and higher increase in the amplitude of Lum-CL and Luc-CL after stimulation of neutrophils with CCM relative to CC. Adsorption of mucin onto prefabricated CC microparticles also contributed to activation of neutrophil CL, unlike mucin adsorption onto yeast cell walls (zymosan); adsorbed mucin partially suppressed zymosan-stimulated production of oxidants by neutrophils. Preliminary treatment of CCM with 0.1–10 mM NaOCl decreased subsequent activation of Lum-CL and Luc-CL of neutrophils depending on the used NaOCl concentration, presumably because of the surface mucin oxidation. Based on the results of ELISA, incubation of neutrophils with CCM downregulated IL-6 production but upregulated that of IL-8. IL-6 and IL-8 gene expression in neutrophils was not affected by CC or CCM according to RT2-PCR data, which means that post-translational regulation was involved. Light microscopy revealed adhesion of CC and CCM microparticles onto the neutrophils; CCM increased neutrophil aggregation with a tendency to form neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). We came to the conclusion that the main features of neutrophil reaction to mucin–vaterite hybrid microparticles are increased oxidant production, cell aggregation, and NET-like structure formation, but without significant cytokine release (except for IL-8). This effect of mucin is not anion-specific since particles of powdered kidney stone (mainly calcium oxalate) in the present study or calcium phosphate nanowires in our previous report also activated Lum-CL and Luc-CL response of neutrophils after mucin sorption. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Introduction: The dissolved mineral content of drinking water can modify a number of excreted urinary parameters, with potential implications for kidney stone disease (KSD). The aim of this study is to investigate the variation in the mineral content of tap drinking water in the United Kingdom and discuss its implications for KSD. Methods: The mineral composition of tap water from cities across the United Kingdom was ascertained from publicly available water quality reports issued by local water supply companies using civic centre postcodes during 2021. Water variables, reported as 12-monthly average values, included total water hardness and concentrations of calcium, magnesium, sodium and sulphate. An unpaired t-test was undertaken to assess for regional differences in water composition across the United Kingdom. Results: Water composition data were available for 66 out of 76 cities in the United Kingdom: 45 in England, 8 in Scotland, 7 in Wales and 6 in Northern Ireland. The median water hardness in the United Kingdom was 120.59 mg/L CaCO<inf>3</inf> equivalent (range 16.02–331.50), while the median concentrations of calcium, magnesium, sodium and sulphate were 30.46 mg/L (range 5.35–128.0), 3.62 mg/L (range 0.59–31.80), 14.72 mg/L (range 2.98–57.80) and 25.36 mg/L (range 2.86–112.43), respectively. Tap water in England was markedly harder than in Scotland (192.90 mg/L vs. 32.87 mg/L as CaCO<inf>3</inf> equivalent; p < 0.001), which overall had the softest tap water with the lowest mineral content in the United Kingdom. Within England, the North West had the softest tap water, while the South East had the hardest water (70.00 mg/L vs. 285.75 mg/L as CaCO<inf>3</inf> equivalent). Conclusions: Tap water mineral content varies significantly across the United Kingdom. Depending on where one lives, drinking 2–3 L of tap water can contribute over one-third of recommended daily calcium and magnesium requirements, with possible implications for KSD incidence and recurrence. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Silicate stones are extraordinarily rare in human beings, but when present, they are often associated with ingestion of Magnesium Trisilicate, an antacid medication. However, there have been few case reports of patients who developed silicate stones, without ingestion of Magnesium Trisilicate. Hereby, we present the case of a 67-year-old man who developed acute kidney injury due to obstructive uropathy, detected during his scheduled chemotherapy for his relapsing multiple myeloma. Abdominal ultrasound and CT scan imaging demonstrated multiple non-mobile calcifications in the bladder neck/prostate bed. Stone analysis showed a material resembling silica. This case with silicate urinary tract stone highlights this extra-rare urinary stone in a patient without any identified source of silicate. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - In hypoparathyroidism (HypoPT), calcium supplementation is virtually always required, although the disease is likely to be associated with an increased risk of nephrolithiasis. The use of calcium citrate (Ca-Cit) theoretically could have a positive impact on the nephrolithiasis risk because citrate salts are used to reduce this risk. Our objective was to evaluate the potential therapeutic advantage of Ca-Cit in comparison with calcium carbonate (CaCO<inf>3</inf>) in HypoPT, on nephrolithiasis risk factors, as well as to their ability to maintain desirable serum calcium levels. We also evaluated these preparations on quality of life (QOL). This randomized, double-blind, crossover trial recruited 24 adults with postsurgical chronic hypoparathyroidism at Campus Bio-Medico University of Rome. Participants were randomized 1:1 to Ca-Cit or CaCO<inf>3</inf> for 1 month and then crossed over to the other treatment for another month. The primary outcomes were changes in albumin-adjusted serum calcium and in ion activity product of calcium oxalate levels (AP[CaOx] index). Secondary efficacy outcomes included changes in SF-36 survey score, fatigue score, constipation, and adverse events. No difference in terms of AP(CaOx) index was observed between the two groups. However, Ca-Cit was associated with a significant reduction in the oxalate/creatinine ratio compared with CaCO<inf>3</inf> (−2.46 mmol/mol [SD 11.93] versus 7.42 mmol/mol [SD 17.63], p = 0.029). Serum calcium and phosphorus concentration was not different between the two calcium preparations. Ca-Cit was associated with less constipation (p = 0.047). No difference was found in QOL scores. Although Ca-Cit did not modify the AP(CaOx) index when compared with CaCO<inf>3,</inf> it was associated with a reduction in urinary oxalate excretion that could have a potential beneficial effect on nephrolithiasis risk. These results are likely to have clinical implications in HypoPT, particularly those who do not tolerate CaCO<inf>3</inf> and those affected by nephrolithiasis. A longer-term experience is needed to confirm these findings. © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - Objective: To describe the ureteropyeloscopic removal of a nephrolith in a horse. Animals: A 19 year old Hanoverian gelding with history of urolithiasis requiring surgical intervention. Study design: Case report. Methods: The horse presented with signs of abdominal straining and stranguria. A proximal urethral calculus was palpable externally within the perineal urethra. Perineal urethrostomy (PU) at the location of the urethral calculi was performed to remove the urethral obstruction. Left nephrolithiasis was then treated by endoscopic retrieval, inserting the endoscope through the PU. The procedures were performed over 2 consecutive days, with the horse standing and sedated. Medical therapy included antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory treatment. Results: The ureteropyeloscopic removal of a nephrolith from the left renal pelvis was completed. No complications were appreciated following the procedure, and the horse was able to return to athletic activity within 2 weeks. The horse had no further clinical signs referable to urinary dysfunction 7 months later. Conclusion: Ureteropyeloscopic removal of a nephrolith from the renal pelvis is technically feasible in the equine patient and preserves function of the affected kidney. The availability of a treatment that maintains renal function is a distinct benefit over unilateral nephrectomy, particularly when treating a condition that frequently involves both kidneys. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Mutations in SLC4A4 have been reported to be associated with proximal renal tubular acidosis (RTA), short stature, band keratopathy, cataract, glaucoma, and hypoplastic-type amelogenesis imperfecta. In this study, the authors describe the clinical manifestations, and investigate the molecular etiology, in a patient with RTA. Case Description: The authors report on a girl with distal RTA who carried a novel homozygous base substitution of 2 consecutive base pair variants (NM_001098484.3:c.808-2A>C and NM_001098484.3:c.808-1G>C) in the SLC4A4 gene. The patient had clinical manifestations of autoimmune thyroiditis and distal RTA, including hypercalciuria, nephrocalcinosis, and nephrolithiasis. In addition to the presence of hypoplastic-type amelogenesis imperfecta, generalized enamel hypomaturation, a feature seen in mice lacking Slc4a4, was also observed in the patient. The basic defect in this patient appeared to be impaired hydrogen ion secretion, leading to an inability to acidify the urine, resulting in alkaline urine (despite a normal serum anion gap), hypokalemic, and hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis. The pulp stones found in the patient may likely be the consequences of a disrupted acid-base homeostatic environment that precipitated mineral deposits. Even with proper treatments for distal RTA, the patient has had frequent recurrences of band keratopathy, pupillary membrane, and cataract. Practical Implications: This is the first report of distal RTA, autoimmune thyroiditis, tooth agenesis, enamel hypomaturation, and pulp stones associated with an SLC4A4 mutation. It is important for dentists to be aware that amelogenesis imperfecta in patients may be a sign of systemic diseases including RTA, nephrocalcinosis, or nephrolithiasis. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is a hypercalcemia disorder with inappro-priately normal or increased serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels resulting from excessive secretion of PTH from one or more of the parathyroid glands. PHPT is uncommon in infants and children, with an estimated incidence of 2–5 cases per 100,000 persons. Patients with PHPT usually present with bone pain, urolithiasis, or nephrolithiasis, as well as nonspecific symptoms such as fatigue and weakness. Asymptomatic hypercalcemia may also be detected incidentally. Only a few cases of pediatric PHPT have been reported in Korea. We present three patients (a 9-year-old girl, a 14-year-old boy, and a 14-year-old girl) with PHPT who manifested variable clinical features of hypercalcemia. The first and second patients each had a parathyroid adenoma and presented with abdominal pain caused by pancreatitis and a ureter stone, respectively. The third patient had an ectopic mediastinal parathyroid adenoma and presented with gait disturbance and weakness of the lower extremities. All of the patients underwent surgical resection of parathyroid adenoma, and their serum calcium levels subsequently normalized without medication. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Atypical parathyroid adenoma (APA) is a rare cause of primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) and represents a diagnostic challenge since it is an intermediate form of parathyroid neoplasm of uncertain malignant potential with atypical histological features that require differential diagnosis of parathyroid carcinoma (PC). We present 2 cases of parathyroid crisis as a presentation of APA. The first case was that of a 56-year-old man with parathyroid crisis, constitutional syndrome, and anemia, with evidence of APA after en bloc resection, evolving with hungry bone syndrome after surgery and curation criteria at 6 months after parathyroidectomy (PTX). The second case was a 64-year-old woman with acute chronic kidney disease and parathyroid crisis, with evidence of APA after selective PTX and >50% reduction in parathyroid hormone levels after surgery; however, persistent PHPT at 6 months post-surgery was observed. These cases represented a diagnostic challenge due to their rare clinical presentation (parathyroid crisis), with a heterogeneous spectrum of target organ damage and infrequent symptoms (constitutional syndrome and acute chronic renal disease), in turn caused by a rare pathology (APA). The presentation of these patients may be indicative of PC; however, histopathological diagnosis is a key to the diagnosis of APA. The differential diagnosis of APA vs. PC in clinical practice is indispensable. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Constipation in children is usually functional constipation without an organic cause. Organic causes of constipation in children, which include Hirschsprung disease, cystic fibrosis, and spinal cord abnormalities, commonly present with red flag signs and symptoms. A history and physical examination can diagnose functional constipation using the Rome IV diagnostic criteria. The first goal of managing constipation is to treat fecal impaction, and then maintenance therapy is used to prevent a recurrence. Polyethylene glycol is the first-line treatment for constipation. Second-line options include lactulose and enemas. Increasing dietary fiber and fluid intake above usual daily recommendations and adding probiotics provide no additional benefits for treating constipation. Frequent follow-up visits and referrals to a psychologist can assist in reaching some treatment goals. Clinicians should educate caregivers about the chronic course of functional constipation, frequent relapses, and the potential for prolonged therapy. Clinicians should acknowledge caregivers’ specific challenges and the negative effects of constipation on the child’s quality of life. Referral to a pediatric gastroenterologist is recommended when there is a concern for organic causes or constipation persists despite adequate therapy. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Context: Bartter syndrome (BS) is a group of rare autosomal-recessive tubulopathies characterized by hypokalemic, hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis in which the primary defect is a deficiency of transporters involved in sodium chloride reabsorption. Type 2 BS results from a defect in the renal outer medullary potassium channel encoded by the KCNJ1 gene. Type 2 BS presents with polyhydramnios, intrauterine growth retardation, prematurity, failure to thrive, polyuria, hypercalciuria, and life-threatening episodes of dehydration. Hypocalcemia is a very rare presenting symptom of BS, with only a few published cases reporting it as the initial manifestation of type 2 BS. Objective: To describe a child who presented with hypocalcemic seizure at the age of 2.3 years that was first related to vitamin D deficiency and high-phosphate soft drink consumption. Methods: Whole exome sequencing (WES) was used to evaluate the biochemical abnormalities of the proband. Results: We identified a previously described homozygous missense mutation c.212C>T, p.T71M in the KCNJ1 gene associated with type 2 BS. Six additional family members with the same mutation and diagnosed clinically with BS are also reported, 2 presenting with hypocalcemia associated with vitamin D deficiency. Conclusion: This report expands the clinical spectrum associated with KCNJ1 mutations and emphasizes the role of WES in unsolved cases of hypocalcemia when genetic disease is suspected. It also highlights the hazardous effects of phosphate-containing soft drinks on calcium metabolism. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Introduction  The aim of the study is to explore the relationship between clinical characteristics and urinary calculus in Xinjiang Uyghur children, and to provide clinical basis for the prevention as well as treatment of urinary stone. Materials and Methods  In total, 236 urinary tract stone samples were collected from pediatric patients from February 2017 to April 2019, and those samples were analyzed by infrared spectroscopy. Stone compositions were compared with demographic data. Results  Among the 236 cases, 166 cases were boys (70.34%) and 70 cases were girls (29.66%), with a male-to-female ratio of 2.37:1. A total of 21 kinds of calculi were detected, including 107 cases with six kinds of simple calculi and 129 cases with 15 kinds of mixed calculi. In this study, magnesium ammonium phosphate hexahydrate was only found in boys, and the difference was statistically significant (6.6 vs. 0.0%, p = 0.037). There were statistical differences in the age distribution of children with ammonium hydrogen urate, calcium oxalate, and other stone components (p < 0.05), while there were no statistical differences in the age distribution of children with apatite carbonate, magnesium ammonium phosphate hexahydrate, and anhydrous uric acid. The results showed that there was a significant difference in the localization of calculi between male and female children (upper urinary tract stones: 78.9 vs. 98.6%, p < 0.001). Conclusion  Uyghur pediatric patients with urolithiasis were young and the majority of stones was mixed, The main components of calculi were ammonium hydrogen urate, calcium oxalate and apatite carbonate, and there are differences in the localization of calculi between genders. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Obstructive and incidental urolithiasis cases were evaluated in 5 Asian colobine monkey species (n= 21 individuals) that included 12 silvery langurs (Trachypithecus cristatus), 6 spectacled langurs (Trachypithecus obscurus), 1 Javan langur (Trachypithecus auratus auratus), 1 François' langur (Trachypithecus francoisi), and 1 red-shanked douc langur (Pygathrix nemaeus) from eight zoologic institutions. All institutions that responded were Association of Zoos and Aquariums, European Association of Zoos and Aquaria, or World Association of Zoos and Aquariums accredited. Males were more commonly represented in the total number of cases (86%), and all cases of obstructive urolithiasis occurred in males. The most common clinical signs observed in obstructive cases included stranguria (58.8%), lethargy (41.2%), anorexia (29.4%), depression (17.6%), and penile manipulation (11.8%). Clinicopathologic abnormalities revealed azotemia (76.5%), anemia (35.3%), and hyperkalemia (23.5%). Eleven of the 21 cases included urinalysis results, and crystalluria was reported in all 11. Obstructive cases were more commonly managed surgically, with medical management following. Instances of individual obstruction ranged from 0 (incidental finding) to 18, with a median of 8 (mean of 4.3) recurrent obstructions. A total of 39 urolith analyses were available from 17 of 21 cases, with calcium carbonate being the most common type isolated (37 of 39, 94.9%). Calcium oxalate was observed in the remaining 5.1% of cases (2 of 39). No cases exhibited a consistent match of crystalluria and urolith type. Death or euthanasia secondary to obstructive urolithiasis occurred in 52.4% of cases. Urinary obstruction secondary to urolithiasis appears to be a relevant cause of morbidity and mortality in Asian colobine species, and further study into etiology and preventive medicine should be undertaken. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - >Parathyroid disorders are most often identified incidentally by abnormalities in serum calcium levels when screening for renal or bone disease or other conditions. Parathyroid hormone, which is released by the parathyroid glands primarily in response to low calcium levels, stimulates osteoclastic bone resorption and serum calcium elevation, reduces renal calcium clearance, and stimulates intestinal calcium absorption through synthesis of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D. Primary hyperparathyroidism, in which calcium levels are elevated without appropriate suppression of parathyroid hormone levels, is the most common cause of hypercalcemia and is often managed surgically. Indications for parathyroidectomy in primary hyperparathyroidism include presence of symptoms, age 50 years or younger, serum calcium level more than 1 mg per dL above the upper limit of normal, osteoporosis, creatinine clearance less than 60 mL per minute per 1.73 m2, nephrolithiasis, nephrocalcinosis, and hypercalciuria. Secondary hyperparathyroidism is caused by alterations in calcium, phosphate, and vitamin D regulation that result in elevated parathyroid hormone levels. It most commonly occurs with chronic kidney disease and vitamin D deficiency, and less commonly with gastrointestinal conditions that impair calcium absorption. Secondary hyperparathyroidism can be managed with calcium and vitamin D replacement and reduction of high phosphate levels. There is limited evidence for the use of calcimimetics and vitamin D analogues for persistently elevated parathyroid hormone levels. Hypoparathyroidism, which is most commonly caused by iatrogenic surgical destruction of the parathyroid glands, is less common and results in hypocalcemia. Multiple endocrine neoplasia types 1 and 2A are rare familial syndromes that can result in primary hyperparathyroidism and warrant genetic testing of family members, whereas parathyroid cancer is a rare finding in patients with hyperparathyroidism. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Purpose: To confirm the exact break-point of a novel long-range deletion discovered in one female parathyroid carcinoma (PC) patient who has a strong family history suggesting familial hyperparathyroidism, and to investigate the expression of parafibromin in the patient’s affected lesion. Methods: Clinical information of one female patient as well as five of her relatives was collected. Their genomic DNA extracted from peripheral blood went through Sanger sequencing and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA). After completing whole genome sequencing (WGS), clone sequencing was also performed, whose result was aligned with standard human genome database after Sanger sequencing. Results: The medical history of recurrent hypercalcemia after parathyroidectomy and histopathological investigation confirmed that the female patient was diagnosed with PC. WGS displayed a novel 130 kb long-range deletion spanning UCHL5 to CDC73 that was later confirmed by clone sequencing. MLPA showed similar results in four of her five relatives, suggesting these people to be carriers of the same long-range deletion, and three among them had a history of primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) ahead of the proband’s first visit. Conclusions: We discovered a novel 130 kb long-range deletion spanning CDC73 in a family of 5 persons, and the existence of the deletion was related to PHPT and PC. Our discovery validated the role of CDC73 mutation in the occurrence of PHPT and PC, which provided new information to the genetic studies of PC. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Purpose: Conventional therapy (calcium and activated vitamin D) does not restore calcium homeostasis in patients with chronic hypoparathyroidism (HypoPT) and is associated with renal complications and reduced quality of life (QoL). The aim of this study was to evaluate in a case–control, cross-sectional study, the rate of renal complications and QoL in two sex- and age-matched cohort of patients with differentiated thyroid cancer with (n = 89) and without (n = 89) chronic post-operative HypoPT (PoHypoPT) and their relationship with the biochemical control of the disease. Methods: Serum and urinary parameters, renal ultrasound and QoL were assessed by SF-36 and WHO-5 questionnaires. Results: Forty-three (48.3%) PoHypoPT patients reported symptoms of hypocalcemia. Twenty-six (29.2%) patients were at target for all 6 parameters, 46 (51.6%) for 5. The most frequently unmet targets were gender-specific 24-h urinary calcium (44.9%) and serum calcium (37.1%). Serum phosphate, magnesium and 25(OH)D were in the normal range in > 90% of patients. Renal calcifications were found in 26 (29.2%) patients, with no correlation with 24-h urinary calcium. eGFR did not differ between patients and controls. Conversely, patients had a significant higher rate of renal calcifications and a lower SF-36, but not WHO-5, scores. SF-36 scores did not differ between PoHypoPT patients who were, or not, hypocalcemic. Conclusions: Our study shows that the rate of renal calcifications was higher in patients with PoHypoPT than in those without. This finding, together with the reduced QoL and the presence of hypocalcemic symptoms in about half patients, underscores that the treatment of chronic HypoPT with conventional therapy is suboptimal. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: In short-bowel syndrome (SBS) treated with parenteral nutrition (PN), multiple complications can occur. The etiology of kidney stones may be linked to the underlying disease thrombosis, surgical complications, complications of therapy for cancer, Crohn's disease, metabolic abnormalities resulting from morphological and functional changes in the gastrointestinal tract, and to treatment used. We analyzed all these parameters in a large cohort of patients receiving home PN (HPN), to define the incidence of stones and groups of patients particularly at risk of stone formation. One of the objectiveswas to develop a predictive model of urolithiasis. Methods: This observational retrospective study included 459 patients with SBS recieving HPN in a single center. Patient records were evaluated for demographics, SBS etiology, and underlying disease, anatomy of the gastrointestinal tract, intestinal failure classification, nutrition regimen, and presence of urolithiasis. Results: Kidney stones were diagnosed in 24% of patients. Nodifferences in incidence were noted between the various etiologic groups. The incidence in patients with a colon in continuity and those with an end stoma was similar. The length of residual small bowel did not play a role in stone formation. There were no differences between patients according to the severity of intestinal failure. In patients treated with PN and limited oral feeding, the risk of urolithiasis was twice as high as in patients receiving PN only. Conclusions: Patients developed urolithiasis with no relation to the SBS etiology. The risk of kidney stone formation was higher in patients recieving PN with oral feeding. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Parathyroidectomy for primary hyperparathyroidism (pHPT) is safely performed in the outpatient setting in the adult population. However, concern that children and adolescents have higher complication rates and are unable to recognize and communicate symptoms of hypocalcemia has limited same-day discharges in the pediatric population. Methods: Nineteen patients aged 8–18 years (14.1 ± 0.7) underwent outpatient parathyroidectomy for pHPT by a single high-volume endocrine surgeon from 2002–2020. Patient demographics, disease, operations, and complications were reviewed. Results: Sixteen of 19 patients were symptomatic with fatigue (62.5%), joint pain (37.5%) and nephrolithiasis (18.7%) most common. Mean preoperative Ca and PTH were 11.7 ± 0.3 mg/dL and 102.3 ± 11.8pg/mL, respectively. Ten of 19 had a single adenoma and 9 had multigland hyperplasia including one MEN1 and one MEN2A patient. We performed 11 four-gland explorations, 8 unilateral parathyroidectomies; including 9 transcervical thymectomies, 1 total thyroidectomy, and 1 bilateral central neck dissection. Mean 6-month postoperative Ca and PTH levels were 9.5 ± 0.3 mg/dL (range 7.3–10.3) and 29±5.0pg/mL (range 6.3–77), respectively. One patient developed permanent hypoparathyroidism and 1 had temporary hypocalcemia. No temporary or permanent hoarseness, unplanned same-day admission, wound complications, or Emergency Department visits occurred. Conclusion: Outpatient parathyroidectomy can be safely and effectively performed in pediatric patients with primary HPT.

AB  - Introduction: Chronic hypoparathyroidism is a relatively rare disease associated with multicomponent medical therapy and various complications. The analysis of large databases of patients with chronic hypoparathyroidism is a necessary tool to enhance quality of medical care, as well as to determine the optimal clinical and therapeutic approaches, and prognostic markers of the disease. The Aim: of this study is to estimate the clinical and biochemical profile, long-term complications, medical therapy and disease control of the patients with chronic postsurgical and non-surgical hypoparathyroidism. Materials and Methods: the cross-sectional, observational, continuous study was based on the Russian Registry of patients with hypoparathyroidism. 544 patients from 63 regions of the Russian Federation were included in this study. Results: The majority of cases had postsurgical etiology (88.4%). Postsurgical hypoparathyroidism prevailed in females (р<0.001). About a half of patients had blood calcium and phosphorus targets, 56 and 52% respectively. Nephrolithiasis was confirmed in 32.5%, nephrocalcinosis - in 12.3% of cases. The risk of nephrocalcinosis/nephrolithiasis increased by 1.85 times with disease duration more than 4.5 years. The cataract was found in 9.4%. The cut-off point for the development of cataracts was 9.5 years, with a 6.96-fold increased risk. The longer duration of hypoparathyroidism of any etiology was associated with more frequent cataract (p=0.0018).We found brain calcification in 4%, arrhythmias in 7.2% and neuropsychiatric symptoms in 5.15% of cases. Generally, the BMD in the studied group corresponded to age values, and there was no evidence for the phenomenon of high bone density. TBS was consistent with normal bone microarchitectonics. In our study, the majority of patients (83.5%) was treated with standard therapy of calcium and vitamin D supplements. 5 patients with severe disease course were treated with rhPTH (1–34). Conclusions: Analysis of the presented database indicates insufficient diagnosis of the complications associated with chronic hypoparathyroidism. Overall, hypoparathyroidism is associated with higher risks of renal stone formation, decreased GFR, cataract especially in patients with longer duration of disease. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Better endoscopic vision is mandatory for successful ureteroscopic stone operations to achieve shorter operating time. However, an important impairing factor for a good endoscopic view is the cloudiness of vision which was formed during laser fragmentation. Holmium laser fragmentation of calcium oxalate stones produces calcium carbonate solubility of which is dependent on pH, citrate, and phosphate. In this ex vivo research, the solubility of calcium carbonate has been investigated in solutions composed of various concentrations of citrate and phosphate buffered at different pH levels after laser fragmentation of calcium oxalate stones. Calcium oxalate stones were placed into the laboratory tubes filled with various concentrations of citrate–phosphate buffers with different pH values. Laser energy in dusting mode was applied to the stones and spectrophotometric measurement for optical density (OD) was calculated for each buffered solution for clarity comparison. In the first phase, solutions composed of four different molar concentrations of citrate–phosphate buffer (0.2, 0.3, 0.4 and 0.5 molars) at various pH levels were used. Then, the next phase of the study was designed to compare solutions demonstrating the lowest OD values with an isotonic saline solution. The results were most convenient at 0.5 molarity (pH = 6) followed by 0.4 molarity (pH = 7) in the first phase (OD values of 0.054 and 0.065, respectively). In the next phase, OD values of both buffered solutions were significantly lower than those of isotonic saline solution (p = 0). Two specific buffers have provided better optic visibility values after laser fragmentation supporting their use as an irrigation solution for the favor of less cloudiness. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - In this study, the presence and types of urine crystals in cats and dogs with urolithiasis/crystaluria and the effects of some demographic factors (such as type, breed, age, sex, sterilization status) on them were evaluated. In the study, physical, chemical and sediment examinations of urine samples of 67 cats and dogs were performed. It was determined that 83.58% of the animals with crystals in their urine were male. It was determined that 63.64% of the female animals and 44.64% of the male animals with crystals detected in the urinary tract were sterilized. It was determined that urinary crystals were more common in cats between 1-3 years of age (AO) and in dogs older than 3 AO. It was determined that calcium oxalate crystal (64.41%) in cats and struvite crystal (50%) in dogs were the most common crystals. It was determined that urine crystals were found mostly in cross breeds in cats and dogs. It was determined that most of the cats and dogs with urine crystals were fed with home meals and non-branded foods. It was determined that urinary tract infections had an effect on the formation of urine crystals. As a result, it was concluded that it is important in terms of Veterinary Medicine that such studies should be routinely performed, especially in the United States of North America (such as the Minnesota Urolith Center), since urine crystals cause significant lower urinary system diseases. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Nephrolithiasis is one of the most important urinary tract diseases of ruminants and a costly problem for many sheep and goat owners. Therefore, it is important to analyse the composition of renal stone to prevent the formation of these kind of stones. The present study aimed to determine the frequency and the chemical constituents of urinary stones of Moghani sheep in Northwest of Iran. The kidneys, ureters, and urinary bladders of 384 Moghani sheep were examined carefully. The prevalence of urinary stones was 3.7%. All the stones were in the pelvis of the kidney and no stones were found in the ureter or urinary bladder. Macroscopically, 85.7% of the urinary stones showed a rough (jagged) appearance and 12.3% of them a smooth appearance. The largest and smallest urinary stoneswere 7 mm and 2 mm in diameter and 0.600 g and 0.087 g in weight, respectively. The composition of calculi was pure or mixed and included calcium oxalate (44.44%), magnesium ammonium phosphate (33.33%) and calcium carbonate (22.22%). In conclusion, the predominant constituent of urinary stones was Calcium oxalate, followed by magnesium ammonium phosphate and calcium carbonate. More detailed studies should be designed to clarify the role of environmental and nutritional factors in the development of urinary stones © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Milk–alkali syndrome (MAS) is a triad of hypercalcaemia, metabolic alkalosis and renal insufficiency. In this study, we present a case of milk–alkali syndrome secondary to concurrent use of over-the-counter (OTC) calcium carbonate-containing antacid tablets (Rennie®) for dyspepsia and calcium carbonate with vitamin D3 (Adcal D3) for osteoporosis. A 72-year-old woman presented with a 2-day history of nausea, vomiting, epigastric pain, constipation, lethargy and mild delirium. Past medical history included osteoporosis treated with daily Adcal D3. Initial blood tests showed elevated serum-adjusted calcium of 3.77 mmol/L (normal range, 2.2–2.6) and creatinine of 292 µmol/L (45–84) from a baseline of 84. This was corrected with i.v. pamidronate and i.v. fluids. She developed asymptomatic hypocalcaemia and rebound hyperparathyroidism. Myeloma screen, vasculitis screen and serum angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) were normal, while the CT of the chest, abdomen and pelvis showed renal stones but no malignancy. A bone marrow biopsy showed no evidence of malignancy. Once the delirium resolved, we established that prior to admission, she had been excessively self-medicating with over-the-counter antacids (Rennie®) as required for epigastric pain. The increasing use of calcium preparations for the management of osteoporosis in addition to easily available OTC dyspepsia preparations has made MAS the third most common cause of hypercalcaemia hospitalisations. Educating patients and healthcare professionals on the risks associated with these seemingly safe medications is required. Appropriate warning labels on both calcium preparations used in the management of osteoporosis and OTC calcium-containing preparations would prevent further similar cases and unnecessary morbidity and hospital admission. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The article provides information about the research were learned the structure and phase composition of urinary tract stones by crystal optical analysis and infrared spectroscopy methods. The study analyzed the structure and mineral composition of urinary tract stones obtained in 37 patients after extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy of kidney and ureter stones. The structure of the calculus was studied on the basis of crystal-optical analysis using a polarizing microscope. The mineral composition of the stone was evaluated by infrared spectroscopy (IRS). 72.9% of the investigated samples of urinary tract stones are represented by the crystalline phase, the main component of which is whewellite, which is present in combination with hydroxylapatite (13.5%), hydroxylapatite and uric acid salts (40.5%), weddellite, carbonate apatite and calcium phosphate (18.9%). In 21.6% of patients, in samples of urinary stones, in addition to the crystalline phase represented by whewellite, an amorphous phase was present in the form of amorphous calcium phosphate (8.1%) and amorphous calcium oxalate (13.5%). In two cases (5.4%), a rare combination of salts was identified: a crystalline phase consisting of uric acid and fluorapatite salts, as well as an amorphous phase in the form of a combination of aragonite and organic acids. Urinary tract stones have a mixed mineral composition, the prevailing component of which is whewellite. The presence of an amorphous phase in the calculus structure, which is the previous stage in the crystallization process, may indicate a relatively young age of the stone. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Objectives: To study childhood nephrolithiasis and nephrocalcinosis caused by metabolic disorders, distal renal tubular acidosis)dRTA(, and familial hypomagnesemia, hypercalciuria, and nephrocalcinosis)FHHNC(. Methods: We retrospectively evaluated 86 children presented over 10 years)2011-2021(, with nephrolithiasis)89%(and nephrocalcinosis)11%(caused by metabolic disorders)62%(, FHHNC)21%(, and dRTA)17%(. Results: The mean age at discovery was 72.7 months. The underlying metabolic etiologies included hyperoxaluria)38%(, cystinuria)32%(, hypercalciuria)24%(, and hyperuricosuria)6%(. Genetic testing was carried out for 23 patients. Hyperoxaluria was typically treated medically)75%(. However, the majority progressed to end-stage kidney disease)ESKD(. Most children with cystinuria, hypercalciuria, and hyperuricosuria required medical and surgical intervention. Patients with FHHNC typically presented with nephrocalcinosis. Genetic testing revealed Claudin-16 mutations in 7 children. Patients often progressed to stage II-IV chronic kidney disease)61%(and ESKD)6%(. Patients with dRTA typically presented with nephrocalcinosis)80%(, as well as poor weight gain and failure to thrive)86%(, and medical treatment included sodium bicarbonate and potassium replacement. Despite nephrocalcinosis progression, most patients had normal renal function)53%(, although the remaining 47% progressed to chronic kidney disease)none reached ESKD(. Conclusion: Childhood nephrolithiasis is mainly related to metabolic disorders and is associated with poor renal outcomes. Nephrocalcinosis and nephrolithiasis have poor outcomes when associated with FHHNC, while nephrocalcinosis associated with dRTA has relatively good renal outcomes. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Purpose: To evaluate the impact of ureteral stenting on the success rate of oral chemolysis in the management of suspected uric acid upper urinary tract (UUT) stones. Methods: Retrospective matched-pair analysis of 172 patients treated with oral chemolysis from 01/2010 to 12/2019. Patients with low density (upon non-contrast enhanced computer tomography [NCCT]), radiolucent (on plain radiography) urinary stones, a low urine pH (< 6) and/or history of uric acid urolithiasis were included. Potassium citrate and/or sodium bicarbonate were used for alkalization (target urine pH: 6.5–7.2). Patient 1:1 matching was performed for the presence of indwelling ureteral stent, stone diameter, stone density, and stone localization. Stone-free status was evaluated after 12 weeks using NCCT. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to assess factors affecting the outcome. Results: Mean patient age was 61 years (73% males). Mean stone size was 12 mm. Overall success rates after 12-weeks of chemolysis for stones at any localization in the UUT and ureteral stones were 60.5 and 77.3%, respectively. Smaller stone size (OR = 0.94; CI 0.888–0.992; p = 0.026) and lower pre-treatment urine pH (OR = 0.131; CI 0.023–0.737; p = 0.021) significantly increased the success of oral chemolysis. Ureteral stenting did not have any impact on the efficacy of oral chemolysis. Conclusion: Oral chemolysis is an effective treatment modality for patients with UUT stones suspected of uric acid content irrespective of ureteral stenting. Smaller stone diameter and lower urine pH at diagnosis increase its efficacy. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Oral alkalization with sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO<inf>3</inf>) or citrate is prescribed for conditions ranging from metabolic acidosis to nephrolithiasis. Although most nephrologists/urologists use this method routinely, extracellular volume (ECV) increase is the main feared adverse event reported for NaHCO<inf>3</inf>. Thus far, no trial has specifically studied this issue in a real-world setting. AlcalUN (NCT03035812) is a multicentric, prospective, open-label cohort study with nationwide (France) enrollment in 18 (public and private) nephrology/urology units. Participants were adult outpatients requiring chronic (>1 month) oral alkalization by either NaHCO<inf>3</inf>-containing or no-NaHCO<inf>3</inf>-containing agents. The ECV increase (primary outcome) was judged based on body weight increase (ΔBW), blood pressure increase (ΔBP), and/or new-onset edema at the first follow-up visit (V1). From February 2017 to February 2020, 156 patients were enrolled. After a median 106 days of treatment, 91 (72%) patients reached the primary outcome. They had lower systolic (135 (125, 141) vs. 141 (130, 150), P = 0.02) and diastolic (77 (67, 85) vs. 85 (73, 90), P = 0.03) BP values, a higher plasma chloride (106.0 (105.0, 109.0) vs. 105.0 (102.0, 107.0), P = 0.02) at baseline, and a less frequent history of nephrolithiasis (32 vs. 56%, P = 0.02). Patients experienced mainly slight ΔBP (< 10 mmHg). The primary outcome was not associated (P = 0.79) with the study treatment (129 received NaHCO<inf>3</inf> and 27 received citrate). We subsequently developed three different models of propensity score matching; each confirmed our results. Chronic oral alkalization with NaHCO<inf>3</inf> is no longer associated with an ECV increase compared to citrate in real-life settings. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The aim of this study was to validate the method for analyzing the composition of calculus using infrared (IR) spectroscopy by studying model mixtures of salts. Study was made with an ALPHA-P IR Fourier spectrometer with OPUS software (Bruker, Germany). The samples of pure chemical salts manufactured by Sigma-Aldrich USA were used to validate the method. Salt mixtures were prepared in ratios of 10/90, 50/50 and 90/10. To assess the effect of the fraction size on the calculus component results, were used calculi of patients with urolithiasis. For each mixture were used 10 repeated measurements. Analysis of the composition of model salts showed that in the study of pure cystine salt CV(%) was 0,79%, calcium carbonate - 0,92%, sodium urate - 0,97%, calcium oxalate monohydrate - 4,94%, magnesium ammonium phosphate - 5,59%. And the most common components were analyzed in the composition of complex mixtures, including 90%, 50% and 10% of the investigated component. Calcium oxalate monohydrate has CV(%) 5.70% in mixture 9 part of it to one part of impurities, in mixture 50/50 - 21.57% and in 10/90 - 5.70%. For uric acid in 90/10 - 2.20%, in 50/50 - 10.09%, in 10/90 - 31.94%. For calcium carbonate in 90/10 - 9.02%, in 50/50 - 11.98%, in 10/90 - 24.70%. The dispersion analysis showed that the weighed portions of salts with a particle diameter of more than 0.8 mm provide reproducibility with a CV - 11.48%, with a diameter of 0.2-0.8 mm - 5.35%, and finally less than 0.1 mm - 2.28%. The accuracy of the method is high, but the reproducibility of the IR-spectroscopy method is relatively low in the analysis of stones of mixed composition, due to the greater error in the determination of impurities. Laboratories should pay special attention to optimizing sample preparation to ensure particle fineness less than 0.1 mm.

AB  - Background: The prevalence of renal calculi in patients with gout is high. Alkalized urine has been recommended by the 2020 European Association of Urology (EAU) guidelines to promote calculus dissolution. However, randomized controlled trials are lacking. Methods: In the protocol of this randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded trial, patients with gout combined with renal calculi are randomized (1:1) to the placebo and sodium bicarbonate groups. The intervention would be performed for 24 weeks, the 1–12 weeks are double-blinded, and the 13–24 weeks are open-labeled. Sodium bicarbonate (1 g tid) will be performed for 24 weeks in the sodium bicarbonate group. The placebo will be performed for 12 weeks and not be performed from 13 weeks to 24 weeks in the placebo group. All subjects will be administered febuxostat (40 mg/day) for 24 weeks and receive concomitant anti-inflammatory prophylaxis therapy for 12 weeks. The primary outcome is the proportion of patients whose renal calculus volume will be reduced after 12 weeks of treatment. The secondary outcomes include the volume changes of renal calculi, uric acid changes, the proportion of patients with serum uric acid (sUA) levels < 360 μmol/L, the changes in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), the pH value of urine, and the incidence of adverse events after treatment for 12 and 24 weeks. Discussion: This study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of sodium bicarbonate-alkalized urine on renal calculi in patients with gout. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov ChiCTR2100045183.

AB  - Hypocalcemia is one of the common causes of neonatal seizures and can result in significant morbidity. Among the multitude of etiologies, hypoparathyroidism as a consequence of maternal hyperparathyroidism is an uncommon one. We describe a neonate who presented with hypocalcemic seizures with relative hypoparathyroidism that unmasked a previously undiagnosed and asymptomatic maternal hyperparathyroidism, and explore the difficulties encountered in the management. Despite initial recalcitrance of hypocalcemia to therapy, parathyroid suppression was transient and recovered completely in few months. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The descriptive cross-sectional study was planned to evaluate drug-related problems, including drug-drug interactions, dose error, use of nephrotoxic drugs and polypharmacy, with special emphasis on kidney disease patients. The study was conducted from January to June 2019 in the Nephrology Ward of Ayub Teaching Hospital, Abbottabad, Pakistan. Doses of medicine and drug-drug interactions were evaluated by comparing it with standard protocols in British National Formulary and Lexicomp. Prescriptions were also evaluated for polypharmacy and use of nephrotoxic drugs. Out of 131 patients, 72 (55%) were males. Drug-drug interactions were found in 69 (52.7%) patients among whom the highest percentage was of moderate drug-drug interaction 63 (48.1%), followed by major 39 (29.8%) and minor 29 (22%) drug-drug interactions. Incidence of polypharmacy 68 (51.9%) and use of nephrotoxic drug 101 (77%) was high, while dose error was low 14 (10.7%). All drug-related problems were present with a high percentage in patients with chronic kidney diseases 29 (78.4) out of 37 (28.2%) such patients. There was significant association of chronic kidney diseases stages with drug-drug interactions, polypharmacy, dose error and prescribing drugs (p<0.05). The higher incidence of drug-related problems reflected irrational prescribing trends and deficiency of professional staff dealing with kidney disease patients. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

Methods: A systematic review was performed using the Medline, EMBASE, and Scopus databases, in concordance with the PRISMA checklist for all English, French, and Spanish language studies regarding the consumption of citrus fruit juices and the relationship to urinary stone disease. The main outcome of interest was the association of citrus fruit juices with KSD. Results: Thirteen articles met the criteria for inclusion in the final review. Three large epidemiological studies found that grapefruit juice was a risk factor for stone formation, while orange juice did not increase the risk for KSD. Ten small prospective clinical studies found that orange, grapefruit, and lemon juices all increased urinary citrate levels. Only orange and grapefruit juices had an alkalinizing effect and while lemon juice has a protective effect by raising urinary citrate levels, it lacked a significant alkalinizing effect on urine pH. Orange juice and grapefruit juices significantly increased urinary oxalate levels, while orange juice also had a high carbohydrate content. Conclusion: While orange juice seems to play a protective role against stone formation, grapefruit was found to raise the risk of KSD in epidemiological studies but had a protective role in smaller clinical studies. Lemon juice had a smaller protective role than orange juice. Larger amounts of, as well as more accurate, data is needed before recommendations can be made and a high carbohydrate content in these juices needs to be taken into consideration. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Urolithiasis in small ruminants has a poor long-term prognosis, and long-term clinical outcomes are variable and unpredictable. Objectives: To assess the accuracy of preoperative and postoperative blood l-lactate concentrations in predicting a negative outcome in goats undergoing tube cystostomy. Animals: Thirty-four male goats undergoing tube cystostomy. Methods: Retrospective study. Medical records of goats undergoing tube cystostomy from 2015 to 2020 were reviewed. Clinical variables recorded included signalment, procedures before surgery, urolith location and type, duration of hospitalization, and heart rate. PCV, plasma total protein, potassium, preoperative and postoperative blood l-lactate concentrations, preoperative and postoperative creatinine concentrations, and relative changes in blood l-lactate and creatinine concentrations over time were measured using heparinized blood. A negative outcome was defined as death or euthanasia from urolithiasis complications at 6 months after discharge. Negative outcomes as a function of independent clinical variables were evaluated using χ2 or Fisher's exact tests, and multivariate logistic regression. P <.05 was considered significant. Results: Median (95% confidence interval) preoperative, postoperative, and the relative change over time of blood l-lactate concentrations were 3.3 mmol/L (2.2, 4.8), 1.0 mmol/L (0.7, 1.3), and 0.4 mmol/L (−3.5, 3.2), respectively. Preoperative (P = 1), postoperative (P =.14), and the relative change over time (P =.63) of blood l-lactate concentrations were not significant predictors of a negative outcome. Furthermore, all other clinical variables measured were not significant predictors of a negative outcome (P >.05). Conclusions and Clinical Importance: Veterinarians should advise clients that clinical outcomes after tube cystostomy in goats are likely unpredictable. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Calcium carbonate (CaCO3), or calcite, stones average 0.15% of annual nephrolithiasis cases. The authors report a 53 year old female, following a 15 year vegan diet, presenting with left flank pain and later found to have bilateral extensive staghorn renal calculi requiring multiple procedures over the course of months. Calcite stone formation is likely attributed to the patient's vegan diet and vitamin supplements. This stone's formation increases with neutral or alkaline urinary pH in the presence of high levels of magnesium. The authors discuss staged surgical treatment plans and non-surgical management prophylaxis with surgery as another possible route for treatment. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Objective: To investigate (1a) agreement of ultrasonographic, surgical, and histopathologic findings in the diagnosis of a neoplastic etiology underlying primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT), (1b) the ability of ultrasonographically determined parathyroid gland size to distinguish between malignant (carcinoma) and non-malignant (hyperplasia, adenoma) pathology, and (2) variables associated with postoperative hypocalcemia in dogs undergoing surgical treatment of PHPT. Study Design: Ambidirectional cohort study. Animals: Forty-seven client owned dogs with PHPT (34 retrospective; 13 prospective). Methods: Data were extracted from medical records. Method agreements were explored using Cohen's Kappa statistic. A receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) was used to determine a cut-off separating parathyroid pathologies. Univariable and multivariable models assessed associations between postoperative hypocalcemia and potential risk factors. Results: Agreement of ultrasound and surgery for number and side of affected glands was 31/47 (65.9%) and 34/47 (72.3%), respectively. In 37/47 (78.7%) cases, parathyroid tissue was correctly assessed as pathologic by the surgeon. An ultrasonographic cut-off of ≥8.0 mm (ROC AUC = 0.82) best distinguished malignant from benign pathologies. Dogs with a preoperative serum ionized calcium (iCa) concentration ≥1.75 mEq/L had 7.5 times greater odds of becoming hypocalcemic postoperatively. Conclusion: A fair agreement existed between ultrasonographic and surgical findings in dogs with PHPT. A parathyroid mass ≥8.0 mm on ultrasonographic examination was suggestive of malignancy, while dogs with a preoperative serum iCa concentration ≥1.75 mEq/L were at increased risk for postoperative hypocalcemia in this study. Clinical significance: This study supports the use of bilateral cervical surgical exploration to identify abnormal parathyroid glands for the treatment of PHPT. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Urethral obstruction is always an emergency for male ferrets and can lead to hyperkalemia. Surgical treatment under general anesthesia can be required. Untreated hyperkalemia before anesthetic induction can be fatal. A 2-year-old, 1.01 kg, neutered male ferret (Mustela putorius furo) was presented for lethargy, hematuria, and stranguria. Radiographs revealed urolithiasis involving the bladder and urethra. When presented for anesthesia, the ferret had hyperkalemia. Before anesthesia, the potassium was normalized rapidly through a combination of saline, dextrose, insulin, and terbutaline. Terbutaline was added to the therapeutic regime as a result of persistent hyperkalemia. Severe hypotension developed during anesthesia which can be partially attributed to the peripheral vasodilatory effect of terbutaline. Hypoglycemia developed as a result of failure to monitor blood glucose level frequently during surgery and suboptimal regime used for insulin and dextrose. Potassium level in a hyperkalemic ferret can be normalized before anesthesia with a combination of therapeutic agents like saline, sodium bicarbonate, insulin, and dextrose. In a case of persistent hyperkalemia, terbutaline can be added to the therapeutic plan. It is important that blood pressure and blood glucose level are monitored closely to prevent hypotension possibly due to terbutaline and hypoglycemia as a result of insulin. The purpose of this report is to describe a case of a ferret with hyperkalemia that needed rapid correction before anesthesia. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Objectives: The pregnancy period, with its peculiarities and specific symptoms that may or may not be physiological, can lead to medication use through prescription or even self-medication. This study aimed to assess self-medication practices among pregnant women, the most used medications, symptoms reported, and factors associated with this practice. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study conducted with pregnant women with an antenatal care (ANC) appointment in a tertiary teaching hospital referral in women’s health. From April 2019 to February 2020, 297 pregnant women were interviewed. Self-medication was considered as the use of any medicine (including medicinal plants (MPs), herbal products, and vitamins) without a medical or dental prescription. The period considered to assess self-medication practice was the last 60 days prior to the study interview. Results: Among the 297 women interviewed, 107 (36.0%) had practiced self-medication in the previous 60 days. Acetaminophen was the most used medication, and headache was the most frequent symptom reported by self-medicated pregnant women. Pregnant women with high-school (73 (68.2%) (OR = 2.52; 95% CI 1.17–5.43; p = 0.018)) or university-level (23 (21.5%) (OR = 2.82; 95% CI 1.15–6.94; p = 0.024)) education had a higher risk of practicing self-medication when compared to women with lower education. Women in the first gestational trimester (35 (32.7%) (OR = 3.61; 95% CI 1.64–7.96; p = 0.002)) and with two or more pregnancies (87 (81.2%) (OR = 1.96; 95% CI 1.07–3.60; p = 0.029)) were more likely to practice self-medication than pregnant women in the second or third gestational trimester and in the first pregnancy, respectively. Conclusion: Self-medication was practiced by a considerable proportion of our sample, with the majority being OTC drugs. The factors associated with self-medication can help to improve prevention strategies regarding self-medication during pregnancy. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Female patient, suffering from nephrolithiasis, at the age of 32 was admitted for renal colic caused by a stone obstructing UP junction with left hydronephrosis. Nephrostomy was placed, resulting in brisk diuresis. Severe metabolic acidosis with normal anion gap and urine pH of 6.5 was noted. Potassium level dropped to extremely low level (1.6 mEq/L), causing muscle paralysis and respiratory failure, necessitating mechanical ventilation. The patient was treated by potassium chloride infusion, followed by correction of severe metabolic acidosis by sodium bicarbonate. Diagnosis of distal type renal tubular acidosis type I (dRTA) was made based on normal anion gap metabolic acidosis, alkaline urine, hypokalemia, and nephrolithiasis. Five years later, the patient presented with severe hypoxia, lung opacities, and bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia which was confirmed by bronchoscopy with lung tissue biopsy. Concurrently, the patient presented with dry mouth, pruritus, skin rash with hypocomplementemia, elevated anti-DNA, anti-Ro, and anti-SmAb. Diagnosis of overlap Sjögren's/systemic lupus erythematosus disease was done and treatment by hydroxychloroquine, prednisone, and azathioprine was started. Possible presence of Sjögren's syndrome should be considered in adult patients with unexplained dRTA. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Objectives: To evaluate the risk of repeat surgery and stone-related events after flexible ureteroscopy (fURS) for renal stones, and to identify their predictive factors. Patients and Methods: This was a single-center, retrospective cohort study of patients (n = 664) who underwent fURS for renal stones with or without concomitant ureteral stones between January 2012 and December 2019. The primary outcomes were time to ipsilateral stone-related surgical intervention and any stone-related event (including ipsilateral renal colic, symptomatic ureteral calculi, obstructive urinary tract infection, and surgical intervention). Results: During median follow-up of 31.1 months, 103 (15.5%) and 135 (20.3%) patients experienced surgical intervention and any stone-related event, respectively. The estimated 2-year intervention-free survival and stone-event-free survival was 86.9% and 81.6%, respectively. On Cox multivariate analysis, younger age (hazard ratio [HR] 0.96), history of stone surgery (HR 2.17), larger preoperative stone burden (HR 1.03), and larger residual fragment (HR 1.09) showed an association with future intervention. Use of the four identified risk factors (age ≤60, history of stone surgery, stone burden ≥20 mm, and residual fragment ≥4 mm) allowed stratification of patients based on the risk of future intervention (low [score: 0-1], intermediate [2], and high [3-4] risk). The estimated 2-year intervention-free survival rates in low-, intermediate-, and high-risk groups were 96.2%, 86.4%, and 71.3%, respectively. Conclusion: Patients undergoing fURS are at risk of future ipsilateral surgical intervention and stone-related events. Our simple predictive tool can facilitate treatment decision-making by identifying patients who are at high risk of recurrence. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - GeoBioMed — a new transdisciplinary approach that integrates the fields of geology, biology and medicine — reveals that kidney stones composed of calcium-rich minerals precipitate from a continuum of repeated events of crystallization, dissolution and recrystallization that result from the same fundamental natural processes that have governed billions of years of biomineralization on Earth. This contextual change in our understanding of renal stone formation opens fundamentally new avenues of human kidney stone investigation that include analyses of crystalline structure and stratigraphy, diagenetic phase transitions, and paragenetic sequences across broad length scales from hundreds of nanometres to centimetres (five Powers of 10). This paradigm shift has also enabled the development of a new kidney stone classification scheme according to thermodynamic energetics and crystalline architecture. Evidence suggests that ≥50% of the total volume of individual stones have undergone repeated in vivo dissolution and recrystallization. Amorphous calcium phosphate and hydroxyapatite spherules coalesce to form planar concentric zoning and sector zones that indicate disequilibrium precipitation. In addition, calcium oxalate dihydrate and calcium oxalate monohydrate crystal aggregates exhibit high-frequency organic-matter-rich and mineral-rich nanolayering that is orders of magnitude higher than layering observed in analogous coral reef, Roman aqueduct, cave, deep subsurface and hot-spring deposits. This higher frequency nanolayering represents the unique microenvironment of the kidney in which potent crystallization promoters and inhibitors are working in opposition. These GeoBioMed insights identify previously unexplored strategies for development and testing of new clinical therapies for the prevention and treatment of kidney stones. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Objectives: To compare the efficacy and safety of citrate mixture and sodium bicarbonate on urine alkalization in gout patients under benzbromarone treatment. Methods: A prospective, randomized, parallel controlled trial was conducted among 200 gout patients in the dedicated gout clinic of the Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University. The participants were randomly divided into two groups (1:1), sodium bicarbonate group (3 g/day) and citrate mixture group (7 g/day). All patients were prescribed with 25 mg/day benzbromarone at initiation and maintained at a dose of 50 mg/day. Clinical and biochemical data were collected at each follow-up time point (baseline, weeks 2, 4, 8 and 12). Results: A total of 182 patients completed the 12-week urine alkalization study. The urine pH value of both groups increased significantly from the baseline to the final follow-up time point (sodium bicarbonate group, 5.50-6.00, P < 0.05; citrate mixture group, 5.53-5.93, P < 0.05). While the comparisons regarding urine pH between treatment groups showed no significant differences for each time point. The estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) dropped significantly after 12 weeks' trial in the sodium bicarbonate group (P < 0.01), while it was comparable between baseline and the last follow-up (P > 0.05) in the citrate mixture group. Results of urine analysis showed that the incident rate of occult blood in the sodium bicarbonate group was higher than that in the citrate mixture group (38 vs 24%, P < 0.05), accompanied by a similar occurrence of kidney stones. After 12-week follow-up, the frequency of twice gout flare in the citrate mixture group was significantly lower than that in sodium bicarbonate group (4 vs 12%, P = 0.037). No treatment-emergent adverse events occurred. Conclusion: The efficacy of citrate mixture on urine alkalization is comparable to sodium bicarbonate under benzbromarone treatment without significant adverse events. Citrate mixture is superior to sodium bicarbonate in lowering the incidence of urine occult blood and the frequency of gout attacks.

AB  - Purpose of review: In this review we revisit normal calcium physiology and define hypo- and hypercalcemia in children. We also provide a physiology-based approach for diagnosis of pediatric calcium disorders with treatment recommendations. Recent findings: Our understanding of genetics and the intricacies of human physiology continues to improve as does our ability to identify causative mutations and uncover the mechanisms underlying disorders of calcium. Calcium homeostasis remains integral to many processes throughout the body and is maintained by a complex interplay of the gut, bone, and kidney. Discovery of the calcium sensing receptor and its control of parathyroid hormone secretion has further enriched our understanding, and recent studies have further elucidated regulation of renal calcium handling. Summary: Hyper- and hypocalcemia remain physiologically important electrolyte derangement with short- and long-term sequela for children. Correct diagnosis of the underlying etiology of these disorders remains central to proper treatment. Newer drugs have enhanced our ability to treat these disorders, most specifically hypercalcemia. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Introduction:Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) in pregnancy is rare and unrecognized because the maternal physiological adaptations blurs the symptoms. There is no standard treatment strategy for maternal PHPT. Early diagnosis and interventions can prevent catastrophic consequences to the mother and fetus.Patient concerns:A 31-year-old Chinese woman was admitted, due to a lump on the left lower leg for 4 months. The patient complained of mild pain in the left lower leg following exercise that could be relieved after a short rest. The patient was at 18 weeks of gestation, and the growth of the fetus was normal. The patient has a 3-year history of hypercalcemia and a 2-year history of nephrolithiasis. No family history of hypercalcemia and endocrine tumors were present.Diagnosis:Laboratory tests demonstrated high serum calcium level of 3.84 mmol/L, parathyroid hormone 1393 pg/mL, alkaline phosphatase 488 μ/L. Ultrasound showed a 22.4 mm × 7.8 mm solid nodule in the left lower lobe of the thyroid gland. Based on these findings, the patient was diagnosed with PHPT.Interventions:The patient accepted continuous renal replacement to reduce ironized calcium level. Parathyroidectomy was performed at the 19th week of gestation. Threatened abortion occurred 2 days after the surgery, and magnesium sulfate was used to prevent the abortion. Calcium gluconate, calcium carbonate and vitamin D3 were used to treat the hypocalcemia that occurred 5 days after the surgery.Outcomes:Pathology examination demonstrated the parathyroid adenoma. Abortion was prevented using magnesium sulfate and hypocalcemia was cured with calcium gluconate, calcium carbonate and vitamin D3. At 38-week of gestation, the patient (ionized calcium level: 2.16 mmol/L) delivered a healthy female baby weighing 2700 g with 10/10 Apgar. Till now, both the mother and infant showed no complications.Conclusion:Maternal PHPT is rare and challenging to diagnose, causing life-Threatening complications to mother and fetus. Any decision regarding surgery for a pregnant woman with primary hyperparathyroidism is more complex than in men or nonpregnant women. The decision should be made based on the severity of hypercalcemia and symptoms. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Osteomalacia is a systemic metabolic bone disease. Hypophosphatemia is one of the most important causes of impaired mineralization. Here, we describe a case of osteomalacia associated with atypical renal tubular acidosis. A 43-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital due to sustained unrelieved bilateral flank pain. She had a history of fragile fracture with vitamin D deficiency and had been treated with active vitamin D. On admission, she presented with hypophosphatemia, hypocalcemia, high bone-specific alkaline phosphatase level, bone pain, and low bone mineral density. Multiple areas of uptake were also confirmed by bone scintigraphy, and she was diagnosed with osteomalacia. An increased dose of alfacalcidol was initiated for her vitamin D deficiency; her symptoms remained unstable and unrelieved. Her blood gas examination revealed metabolic acidosis without an increase in the anion gap (HCO3- 11.8 mEq/L, anion gap 3.2 mEq/L). Tubular dysfunction, tubular damage, kidney stones, and inadequate urinary acidification were all observed, suggesting the presence of renal tubular acidosis from a combination of both distal and proximal origin. She also had overt proteinuria, decreased renal function, and hypothalamic hypogonadism. In addition to alfacalcidol, sodium bicarbonate and oral phosphorus supplementation were initiated. After this prescription, her pain dramatically improved in association with the restoration of acid-base balance and electrolytes; renal dysfunction and proteinuria were unaltered. This case indicated that careful assessments of tubular function and acid-base balance are essential for the management of osteomalacia in addition to the evaluation of the calcium/phosphate balance and vitamin D status.

AB  - Background: Orthopaedic surgeons prefer calcium supplement for various pathologies like fracture, osteoporosis, chronic musculoskeletal pain, yet there is no proper evidence to support the benefits of taking them regularly. The average requirement for calcium is around 500–1000 mg/day for a healthy adult, this amount of calcium is not achieved by diet, especially in developing countries like India. Despite this, the serum calcium level remains unaltered, due to the well-controlled absorption and excretion of calcium by the human body. As there is no clarity over the dose, duration and the prefered calcium salts, we constructed a survey to find the preferred dose, duration, the preferred calcium salts among orthopaedic surgeons, and to give an in-depth review of literature about dose, duration, timing, preferred calcium salt and various other calcium-related queries. Materials and method: The survey included 15 pre-structured questionnaires; these questions were formatted and validated by senior surgeons and other specialists after a through a review of calcium-related literature. These questionnaires were used in a pilot study conducted within the department and were later modified and separated into 7 sections. Data were collected by both online survey (google forms) and direct interviews. Result and conclusion: 128 Orthopedic surgeons responded. The total number of response obtained was 2355. Unanswered questions were 152. From the survey, it was found that most orthopaedic surgeons prefer to prescribe calcium routinely (55.46%). The commonly used calcium salt was calcium carbonate (47.65%), followed by citrate (32.8%). 42.18% were not aware of the efficiency of prescribing calcium in divided doses. Most responded that calcium is not to be given for patients with renal stones, but literature shows that calcium prescribed reduces the recurrence of commonest kidney stones, calcium oxalate stones. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Calcium, phosphorus, and vitamin D are nutrients that play a key role in maintaining normal organ, cell, and tissue function. Much is known about their role in bone metabolism, but these nutrients are also important in renal health, urinary tract disease, and multiple other organ systems. It is nutritionally important to meet the physiologic requirements for each of these nutrients, but the interplay between them should also be considered. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: The use of prescription diets for cats with chronic kidney disease (CKD) is one of the main management approach of this disease in cats, and is considered a renoprotective strategy that may promote increased survival and/or improve quality of life, according to the stage of CKD. Besides that, nutritional assessment is important to monitor the maintenance of quality of life of the patients and their response to disease, especially those with chronic conditions. The aim of this study was to follow the clinical and nutritional status of cats with chronic kidney disease (CKD) IRIS stages II, III and IV fed with a renal prescription diet, followed for 12 months. Materials, Methods & Results: Patients were fed exclusively with a dry renal prescription diet and medications for the management of CKD were prescribed when needed. Exclusion criteria were cats that already received a renal prescription diet or medications for the treatment of CKD. Cats were evaluated every 2 months, considering body weight (BW), body condition score (BCS), muscle mass score (MMS), clinical and laboratory parameters. In all assessments, a complete blood count and biochemistry were performed by conventional methods with the patient fasted for 12 h. In addition, urinalysis, urine protein:creatinine ratio (UPC) and urine culture were performed from a urine sample collected by cystocentesis. The quantitative variables were tested for their stability on consecutive assessments using the non-parametric Friedman test, and did not present significant variation during follow-up, except for systolic blood pressure (SBP). Eight cats with a diagnosis of CKD were included in the study and 6 of them remained in the same CKD stage during follow-up. On cat died due to an unrelated CKD cause. Regarding nutritional assessment, 5 of 7 cats maintained BW during the 12 months. Of these, 4 also maintained MMS and BCS. Three of 7 cats presented a decrease in MMS, 2 of which presented also a decreased BW and one maintained BW. Discussion: IRIS staging results combined with Friedman’s analysis demonstrated that the diet and the clinical management were effective in the non-progression of CKD in this study. As renal injury is not expected to be reversed in CKD, the maintenance of cats in the same IRIS stages and the minimum variation of the parameters is considered a positive result in this study. Hypertensive cats started on antihypertensive therapy during the study, achieving adequate control of SBP in most cases, what can justify the variation of this clinical parameter over the 12 months. Hyperphosphatemia was a frequent alteration, included stage II cats, and presented a positive response to nutritional and medical therapy. Despite CKD staging progression was not observed in most cats using serum creatinine as a single parameter, some cats presented BW and MMS reduction, which may have influenced this result. Weight loss and muscle wasting may have occurred by several reasons, including periods of hyporexia, presence of concomitant diseases, aging process or reduced protein content on renal prescription diets. This study enhances the importance of the association of clinical and nutritional management in the maintenance of cats with CKD. We suggest that other studies are done during longer periods of time and with a larger sample to support the results found. We also suggest new studies to evaluate the protein requirements for cats with CKD. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Objective: To estimate the prevalence of Chronic renal failure (CRF) in the Indian subcontinent and to identify risk factors and treatment regimens for CRF. Methods: A prospective observational study was carried out for 7 months. A total of 200 patients with a level of creatinine >1.5 mg/dl were enrolled. CRF prevalence was measured using the hospital's inpatient department registry and medical records. The risk factors and prescribing were evaluated from the patient file report. Results: The prevalence rate of CRF was 13.7%. Male patients (59%) dominate the entire group of patients. Most patients (n = 52) were found between the age group of 71-80 years with a mean age of 62.67 ± 16.33 years. Drugs such as diuretics, and hypoglycemics were indicated to treat comorbidities. The average number of drugs per prescription were 7.43 ± 2.75 with high use of antimicrobial agents (88%). Out of 156 drugs prescribed, 76 were from essential as per essential Drug List 2017. Hypertension (P = 0.0072) and diabetes (P = 0.0084) were major concerns as risk factors followed by the drugs used for dyslipidemia, and recurrent infections. Conclusion: The prevalence rate was found to be 13.7% with significant association with risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, dyslipidemia, chronic infections, smoking, and renal calculus for CRF. The pattern of prescribing was suitable and with few irrationalities. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Kidney and uteric stones are a common cause of pain and disturbance in numerous people worldwide, as they tend to reappear. There are several studies investigating the association of urolithiasis and nephrolithiasis with atherosclerosis, as patients suffering from the former diseases were found to have been diagnosed with atherosclerotic plaques. Hydroxyapatite and calcium oxalate are the most common mineral crystals found in both kidney/uteric stones and atherosclerotic plaques’ calcifications. Even though for stones smaller than 5 mm surgery is not recommended, the knowledge of the stone composition is an important tool for the physician in order to provide better treatment for the patient. The mineral crystal characterization of atherosclerotic plaques’ calcifications smaller than 3 mm (spotty calcifications) will assist the physician to limit the possibility of myocardial infraction and stroke, as the presence of hydroxyapatite indicates possible plaque rapture. To this aim, a dual energy (DE) X-ray method was developed in this work. The calcium/phosphorus mass ratio (mCa/mP) was determined through analytical simulations and the results were verified experimentally. Both monoenergetic and polyenergetic simulation studies were implemented for hydroxyapatite, calcium carbonate and calcium oxalate with thicknesses ranging from 0.50 to 3.00 mm, at 100 µm increments, to obtain the optimized irradiation conditions. The experimental verification of the proposed method was performed using an X-ray tube combined with a high resolution complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) active pixel sensor (APS) detector. The Mann- Whitney U test indicated that statistically significant differences were found between the different types of minerals examined for thicknesses of 0.70 mm or higher. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The examination of the urinary sediment of a 64-year-old woman showed the presence of three different types of crystals, all with unusual morphology, which could not be identified with bright field microscopy, polarized light, and the knowledge of urine pH (7.5). The use of microscopic infrared spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy led to the identification of the three types of crystals as calcite, vaterite and aragonite, which are all variants of calcium carbonate crystals. This paper confirms the complex morphology and nature that urinary crystals may at times have and the utility of advanced infrared spectroscopy techniques for their identification. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Objective: To study the etiological profile and patterns of clinical presentations of urolithiasis (UL) in children. Methods: This observational study included patients <18 y with UL, who were referred to the pediatric nephrology clinic. Clinical features, family history, consanguinity and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) at presentation and follow-up were recorded. The children were evaluated using relevant blood and urine investigations. Results: A total of 72 children with UL were evaluated for the study. The etiology of UL (n = 72) included hyperoxaluria (n = 25; 34.7%), idiopathic hypercalciuria (n = 21; 29.2%), idiopathic hyperuricosuria (n = 3; 4.2%), cystinuria (n = 3; 4.2%), urate transporter defect (n = 2; 2.8%) and mixed stones (predominant component calcium oxalate) (n = 9; 12.5%). No etiology was detected in 4 cases (5.5%). Common presenting complaints included flank pain (n = 41; 56.7%), hematuria (n = 29; 40.3%), urinary tract infection (UTI) (n = 29; 40.3%) and vomiting (n = 11; 15.3%). The median age of presentation was 60 (36, 96) mo. Family history and consanguinity were present in 30 cases (41.7%) and 28 cases (38.9%) respectively. Stone analysis was done in 20 cases, of which 9 cases were mixed stones (predominant calcium oxalate) and 6 were calcium oxalate stones. Conclusions: Among children with urolithiasis, hyperoxaluria, idiopathic hypercalciuria, idiopathic hyperuricosuria, and cystinuria were the predominant identifiable entities, together accounting for 72% of cases; and renal colic, hematuria and UTI were the commonest clinical complaints. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Cocoyam (Araceae family) tuber, like purple taro, traditionally are used as sources of non-rice carbohydrates in Aceh Province, Indonesia. But it contain high calcium oxalate, which contributes to kidney stones formation. Immersion in strong acid (HCl) solution can reduce calcium oxalate. However, it will cause a very strong taste and aroma in cocoyam flour. So, it is necessary to use other immersion methods. This research aimed to examine the effect of the immersion method to reduce calcium oxalate in purple taro flour. The immersion methods used in this research are weak acids (CH3COOH), salt (NaCl), and alkaline salt (NaHCO3). Calcium oxalate, moisture, and ash content were the parameters observed in this study. The result showed that all immersion methods can reduce calcium oxalate levels in purple taro flour. The lowest oxalate content (42.64 mg/100 g) was obtained by the NaHCO3 immersion method. The NaHCO3 had a significant effect to decrease calcium oxalate content in purple flour © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Small ruminants frequently experience urologic conditions, such as obstructive urolithiasis, posthitis, vulvitis, and urinary tract infections. Urologic conditions are more common in male small ruminants, especially castrated males, primarily due to their anatomy. Traditionally, urologic conditions warranted culling from the herd without significant efforts in treatment. However, more goats and sheep are now being kept as pets. Small ruminant owners have strong emotional attachments to their animals and are more likely to seek treatment of medical disorders, including urologic conditions. Surgical or medical treatments are available. Conditions also may be avoided through hydration, diet, hygiene, and other means. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) is a rare inherited endocrine disorder with a high rate of penetrance. The incidence of MEN1 is 1/30,000 in the general population; however, it is quite rare for a patient to present for medical attention with MEN1 for the first time in pregnancy. Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is one of the most common features of MEN1. The incidence of PHPT occurring in pregnancy is 1%. Despite advances in the medical, surgical and obstetric care over the years, management of this condition during pregnancy may be challenging. It can be difficult to identify pregnant women with PHPT requiring intervention and to monitor safely. Hypercalcemia can result in significant maternal and fetal adverse outcomes including: miscarriage, intrauterine growth restriction, preterm delivery, neonatal hypocalcaemia, pre-eclampsia and maternal nephrolithiasis. Herein, we present a case study of a lady with a strong family history of MEN1, who was biochemically proven to have PHPT and evidence of Zollinger Ellison Syndrome (ZE) on endoscopy. This patient delayed her assisted pregnancy plans for in vitro fertilization (IVF) until completion of the MEN1 workup; nevertheless, she spontaneously achieved an unplanned pregnancy. As a result, she required intervention with parathyroidectomy in the second trimester of her pregnancy as her calcium level continued to rise. This case study highlights the workup, follow up and management of MEN1 presenting with PHPT and ZE in pregnancy. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Patients with tumor-induced osteomalacia (TIO), an acquired paraneoplastic condition characterized by osteomalacia due to hypophosphatemia, exhibit a similar clinical picture to those with X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets/osteomalacia (XLH). The human monoclonal anti-fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) antibody burosumab (KRN23) increases serum phosphate and improves bone turnover, fracture healing, pain, and physical function in XLH patients by inhibiting circulating FGF23; thus, burosumab is expected to be an effective treatment for TIO. We report here an interim analysis of a multicenter, open-label, intraindividual dose-adjustment study of burosumab (0.3 to 2.0 mg/kg every 4 weeks) in Japanese and Korean TIO patients. The primary endpoint was the fasting serum phosphate level at each visit. Key secondary endpoints were changes over time in bone biomarkers, pharmacodynamic markers, bone histomorphometric parameters, motor function, and patient-reported outcomes. Safety was assessed based on treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs). Thirteen patients received burosumab treatment, of whom 4 underwent bone biopsy. The mean dose after week 112 was approximately 1.0 mg/kg. After the first burosumab administration, mean serum phosphate levels increased and remained above the lower limit of normal and in the normal range from weeks 14 to 112. Bone biomarkers initially increased, reaching maximum values at week 16 or 24, and then gradually decreased. After burosumab treatment, patients were able to walk further (evaluated by the 6-minute walk test), reported decreased pain levels, and showed a tendency toward healing of baseline fractures and pseudofractures. Two patients discontinued, one each due to disease progression and consent withdrawal. Burosumab was generally well tolerated, with no treatment-related TEAEs of grade ≥3 and no treatment-related serious AEs. In conclusion, the interim results of this first study of burosumab to treat TIO patients indicate that this drug has the potential to provide clinical benefit for patients with unresectable tumors. The full study results are eagerly anticipated. © 2020 The Authors.

AB  - Background: Obstructive urolithiasis is a rare but potentially serious condition in equids. In the reviewed literature, there are several case reports of urolithiasis in horses and donkeys, but the only mention of this condition in mules occurred as incidental findings at a slaughterhouse. Therefore, this work aims to describe the first report and successful treatment of obstructive urethrolithiasis in a mule (Equus asinus x Equus caballus). Case: A 10-year-old castrated male mule weighing 380 kg was referred for hospital care. Tachycardia (64 beats per min), mild dehydration (7%), increased capillary filling time (3 s), slightly congested mucous membranes, and dysuria were observed. During its attempts to urinate, the mule was able to expose the penis, resulting in only dribbling of urine with reddish coloration. Urethral catheterization failed to reach the urinary bladder and revealed an obstruction at the ischial arch (7 x 4 cm), as confirmed by palpation and ultrasonography. Additionally, rectal ultrasound examination showed urine sedimentation and a single 2.36 mm vesical calculus. After sedation, local anesthesia, and surgical preparation, urethrotomy in the standing position was performed over the urethral obstruction at the ischial arch, reaching the urethrolith that fragmented during removal. Urethral catheterization from the urethrotomy site to flush the urinary bladder and urethra were performed, but the remaining vesical calculus was not retrieved. Considering the presence of a vesical calculus, severe urethral damage caused by the spiculated calculus and catheterization attempts, permanent perineal urethrostomy was performed. Laboratory tests revealed unremarkable hematological parameters, while serum biochemistry showed increased creatinine level. Urinalysis revealed cloudiness, amber appearance, countless red blood cells and bacteria, and calcium carbonate crystals. The urethrolith composition included ammonia, carbonate, and oxalate. Twelve months after surgery, the mule was healthy, the urethrostomy was viable, and no complications were recorded during this period. Discussion: Although uncommon, there are reports describing calculi of different sizes and weighing up to 803 g, causing mild to severe clinical signs according to the degree of obstruction in horses and donkeys. In the mule described here, the urethrolith did not completely obstruct the urethra, but the spiculated calculus caused dysuria and hematuria. In fact, most animals are usually referred for acute abdominal signs or hematuria and pollakiuria, but other unusual signs, such as rectal prolapse, may also be present. In the present report, the diagnosis of obstructive urethrolithiasis was established based on clinical signs and transcutaneous ultrasound of the subischial area, allowing visualization of the urethrolith. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of obstructive urethrolithiasis affecting a mule in Brazil. We reiterate that this condition must be included in the differential diagnosis of mules and hinnies with hematuria and dysuria, especially when associated with abdominal pain. Additionally, urethrostomy associated with urethrotomy performed on this mule in the standing position was a low-cost procedure with good results. Due to the lack of specificity regarding the food management of the mule on the previous farm, an assessment cannot be made regarding the effects of its food on urolith composition. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Kidney stones and atherosclerotic plaques have an increasing rate worldwide. Although kidney stones are not life threatening, as atherosclerosis can be, they have the tense of reappearing after a period of time. Based on several studies it seems there is a correlation between these two diseases, as patients diagnosed with urolithiasis or nephrolithiasis appeared to have atherosclerotic plaques. Calcium oxalate and hydroxyapatite are the most frequently found minerals in stones. Calcium carbonate stones have also been present, but not in the same prevalence. Stones smaller than 5 mm are expected to pass on their own and thus no surgery is needed. However, each stone composition needs different treatment to be removed since they have different structural integrity among the same therapies. The very same minerals were found in spotty calcifications (<3 mm) in atherosclerotic plaques. Spotty calcifications, especially hydroxyapatite calcifications, act as an indicator of possible plaque rapture, while calcium oxalate is identified in stable plaques. Thus, the calcifications' mineral differentiation will help the physicians to prevent myocardial infraction and stroke. To this aim, a dual-energy X-ray method was developed in this study. Simulation and experimental studies were conducted for the determination of the Calcium/Phosphorus mass ratio (mCa/mP). Monoenergetic and polyenergetic simulation studies were carried out for calcium oxalate, hydroxyapatite and calcium carbonate calcifications with thicknesses ranging from 0.5 to 3 mm, in order to find the optimized irradiation conditions. The experimental evaluation of the method was implemented with an X-ray tube combined with an energy integrating (imaging) detector. Based on the experimental results, for both kidney stones and atherosclerotic plaques, statistically significant difference was observed between the different types of minerals for thicknesses of 0.7 mm or higher. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Work-up of patients with calcium oxalate stones should be restricted to those who have multiple episodes (50% of stone formers). There are exceptions, such as pilots, fire-workers, people in the armed forces, those with a single kidney and children (<19 years old). The most important aspect of therapy is to correct dietary aberrations, i.e. the ‘clinic effect’. The four golden rules to correct dietary influences are to maintain an adequate 24-hour urine volume, to restrict salt intake, to avoid red meat and to avoid a diet high in oxalate. In particular, Ceylon tea is contraindicated, as it contains excess oxalate. Drink coffee instead. In patients with hypocitraturia, the drug of choice is potassium citrate, which is the only acceptable urinary alkaliser. Other preparations, such as Urolyte-U, Citrosoda, etc., all have a high sodium content, which will influence urinary calcium excretion. In patients with ongoing hypercalciuria, thiazides are contraindicated in the management of recurrent calcium oxalate stones, and indapamide is the drug of choice. The treatment and follow-up are lifelong. In addition, poor adherence to treatment, coupled with repeated urological procedures, may result in renal functional deterioration and even occasionally renal failure. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The first reports of hypersensitivity reactions following the rollout of COVID-19 vaccination programs have raised public concern. Given the recent availability and novel mechanisms of COVID-19 vaccines, there is limited data on possible hypersensitivity reactions. Although it seems rare, the incidence of anaphylaxis for approved COVID-19 vaccines has been suggested as being higher when compared to previous vaccines. Adequate risk assessment, recognition, classification, and management of hypersensitivity reactions is crucial to ensure safe immunization and avoid misinformation and vaccine hesitancy. In this review, we present an overview of the types of hypersensitivity reactions that can potentially occur due to vaccination and the possible allergenic components of COVID-19 vaccines as well as a suggestion for causality and risk assessment for the BNT162b2 mRNA-1273 and AZD1222 vaccines. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is a rare disorder in children and adolescents. Typical biochemical features are hypercalcemia and hypophosphatemia, but the clinical features can be heterogeneous, and in some cases, symptoms are vague and nonspecific, leading to misdiagnosis or late diagnosis. Herein, we report two cases of PHPT in pediatric age with different presenting symptoms, pain in the foot, and progressive alteration of the gait in the first case and recurrent abdominal pain with emotional lability in the second. Biochemical and radiological assessment confirmed PHPT. Both cases were treated surgically as definitive treatment, but in the second case, previous medical treatment with cinacalcet, a calcimimetic agent, was required to reduce serum PTH and calcium levels. After surgery, despite conventional treatment with calcium and calcitriol, case 1 developed a hungry bone syndrome. The analysis of the MEN-1 (Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia) gene was negative in both cases. A diagnosis of PHPT should be considered when children or adolescents present bone pain with radiological imaging of osteolytic lesion and biochemical feature of hypercalcemia associated with hypophosphatemia. In PHPT, the gold standard treatment is represented by surgery followed by strict postoperative endocrine monitoring to maintain adequate homeostasis of calcium and bone metabolism. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: The modern approach in the treatment of urolithiasis involves the use of non-invasive and minimally invasive techniques based on the stone fragmentation, among which shock wave lithotripsy (SWL) is considered as the first-line treatment for kidney stones < 2 cm and proximal ureter stones. Objective: To study the microstructure and mineral composition of kidney stones and to evaluate their influence on the stones’ susceptibility to fragmentation by shock waves. Methods: The microstructure and mineral composition of kidney stone samples obtained from shock wave lithotripsy in 87 patients were studied using crystal optical analysis and infrared spectroscopy. The volume fraction of amorphous and crystalline phases of the stone composition, the quantitative and qualitative composition of mineral components were assessed. The fragmentation features of stones with different microstructure were retrospectively analyzed based on the total number of shock waves required for complete stone fragmentation. Results: Three kidney stone structure types were identified: amorphous-crystalline structure stones predominantly including the amorphous phase (type A); amorphous-crystalline structure stones predominantly including the crystalline phase (type B); fully crystalline structure stones (type C). Significant positive correlation between the total number of shock waves required for complete stone fragmentation and the volume fraction of crystalline phase was found. Conclusion: The structure type of kidney stones is determined by the volume ratio between the amorphous and crystalline phases of their composition. The amorphous-crystalline structure stones with the predominant content of the amorphous phase are more sensitive to shock-wave exposure. The increase in the volume fraction of crystalline phase in the stone structure reduces the stone’s susceptibility to fragmentation by shock waves. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

However, Al-adjuvants have been implicated as potential contributors to a severe wasting syndrome in sheep— the so-called ovine autoimmune-inflammatory syndrome induced by adjuvants (ASIA syndrome). This work aimed to characterize the effects of the repetitive injection of Al-hydroxide containing products in lambs. Four flocks (Flocks 1–4; n = 21 each) kept under different conditions were studied. Three groups of seven lambs (Vaccine, Adjuvant-only, and Control) were established in each flock. Mild differences in average daily gain and fattening index were observed, indicating a reduced growth performance in Vaccine groups, likely related to short-term episodes of pyrexia and decreased daily intake. Clinical and hematological parameters remained within normal limits. Histology showed no significant differences between groups, although there was a tendency to present a higher frequency of hyperchromatic, shrunken neurons in the lumbar spinal cord in the Adjuvant-only group. Although Al-hydroxide was linked to granulomas at the injection site and behavioral changes in sheep, the results of the present experimental work indicate that injected Al-hydroxide is not enough to fully reproduce the wasting presentation of the ASIA syndrome. Other factors such as sex, breed, age, production system, diet or climate conditions could play a role. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Introduction: Gain-of-function mutations in the CASR gene cause Autosomal Dominant Hypocalcemia Type 1 (ADH1), the most common genetic cause of isolated hypoparathyroidism. Subjects have increased calcium sensitivity in the renal tubule, leading to increased urinary calcium excretion, nephrocalcinosis and nephrolithiasis when compared with other causes of hypoparathyroidism. The traditional approach to treatment includes activated vitamin D but this further increases urinary calcium excretion. Methods: In this case series, we describe the use of recombinant human parathyroid hormone (rhPTH)1–84 to treat subjects with ADH1, with improved control of serum and urinary calcium levels. Results: We describe two children and one adult with ADH1 due to heterozygous CASR mutations who were treated with rhPTH(1–84). Case 1 was a 9.4-year-old female whose 24-h urinary calcium decreased from 7.5 to 3.9 mg/kg at 1 year. Calcitriol and calcium supplementation were discontinued after titration of rhPTH(1–84). Case 2 was a 9.5-year-old male whose 24-h urinary calcium decreased from 11.7 to 1.7 mg/kg at 1 year, and calcitriol was also discontinued. Case 3 was a 24-year-old female whose treatment was switched from multi-dose teriparatide to daily rhPTH(1–84). All three subjects achieved or maintained target serum levels of calcium and normal or improved urinary calcium levels with daily rhPTH(1–84) monotherapy. Conclusions: We have described three subjects with ADH1 who were treated effectively with rhPTH(1–84). In all cases, hypercalciuria improved by comparison to treatment with conventional therapy consisting of calcium supplementation and calcitriol. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Nephrolithiasis, commonly known as kidney stones, may be localized to any part of the urothelial system, causing common systemic symptoms, some of which may become acute. Primary care physicians increasingly are the first line of management for this condition, making recognition and prompt treatment essential. This article highlights the pathogenesis of kidney stones, the risk factors for their formation, and common complications. The article concludes with management guidelines for nephrolithiasis and when primary care physicians should refer patients to nephrology or urology. In light of the current opioid epidemic, salient points for nonopioid treatment as initial treatment of nephrolithiasis likewise are discussed. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Oxalate is a metabolite consumed in nuts, beans and leaves, and excreted in urine. Oxalosis can cause nephropathy. We describe a rare case of a high-oxalate diet intended for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) treatment causing oxalate nephropathy. A 59-year-old woman with a history of controlled hypertension presented with creatinine 1.8 mg/dL, increased from baseline 1.3 mg/dL. She denied recent illness, urinary stones, medication adjustments, herbal supplements and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs use. Diet included six tablespoons of chia seeds and five handfuls of almonds daily to manage IBS symptoms. Her electrolytes, urinalysis and renal ultrasound were unremarkable. Her 24-hour urine output revealed increased oxalate and low citrate. Renal biopsy showed glomerulosclerosis, fibrosis and calcium oxalate deposition. She switched to a low-oxalate diet, with improvement in laboratory markers. An earlier dietary history could have raised concern for oxalosis prior to renal biopsy. Providers should be trained to identify at-risk patients and provide appropriate dietary counselling. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is a common endocrine condition which disrupts physiologic calcium regulation. PHPT causes persistent hypercalcemia via the elevated and constant secretion of parathyroid hormone. Due to the effects of parathyroid hormone on target organs such as the bones, kidneys and gastrointestinal tract, untreated PHPT can lead to complications such as decreased bone mineral density, nephrolithiasis, and chronic abdominal pain, respectively. Given PHPT's drastic effect on calcium metabolism, it is likely that the condition also affects other organ systems, such as the inner ear, which rely on calcium for normal structure and function. Specifically, the saccule and utricle have otoconia made of calcium carbonate deposited on a protein framework. We hypothesize that PHPT, the epitome calcium disorder, can cause otoconia degeneration, one manifestation of which is benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). As a preliminarily test of this hypothesis, we measured the levels of otolin-1, an inner ear glycoprotein found in the otoconia protein framework and a proposed biomarker for otoconia degeneration in patients with PHPT. We found a positive linear relationship between PTH (parathyroid hormone) and otolin-1 levels (R2 = 0.53) and total calcium and PTH levels (R2 = 0.32). These findings suggest that both PTH and total calcium levels affect otolin-1 levels, implying that the calcium dysregulation caused by PHPT may contribute to the otoconia breakdown and may be associated with inner ear disorders such as BPPV. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Antacids are usually a class of medication that neutralize stomach acidity and makes its pH more neutral. Commonly used self prescribed medications. Antacids usually consist of magnesium, calcium carbonate and aluminium salts in various compounds or in combination. Gastric acid related disorder could be treated using antacids. Ingestion of antacids must be followed only after ingestion of Meals. The main aim of the survey was to create awareness on application of antacids among undergraduate students. A questionnaire was prepared and administered to 100 participants through an online Google forms link. Study participants included undergraduate students of 18-26 age group. Method of representation of each output variable was in pie chart form. The result was then statistically analyzed using SPSS software. The result was analyzed as 64% were aware on the application of antacids. 55% think antacids are only used to neutralize acidity but other research shows it can reduce activity of pepsin. 45% feel common side effects of overusing antacids are constipation, Diarrhea, Kidney stones. It shows that severe side effects are rare, although they can occur in high-risk patients. But minor problems like change in bowel habits can occur frequently. This study concludes that antacids have a high neutralizing capacity and give relief and comfort. Also inactivate Pepsin to relieve symptoms and provide temporary relief and comfort. Natural foods like mint, milk, Banana, ginger can be taken instead of antacids. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Cocoa bean and its products are high-value, nutritious foods, but also contain considerably amounts of soluble oxalate that is linked with increased incidences of forming kidney stones. This study investigated the potential of reducing soluble oxalate contents in cocoa powder by mixing with three calcium salts (calcium carbonate CaCO<inf>3</inf>, calcium chloride dihydrate CaCl<inf>2</inf>.2H<inf>2</inf>O and calcium sulfate dihydrate CaSO<inf>4</inf>.2H<inf>2</inf>O), three milk varieties (full-cream, low-fat and high-calcium milk) and ultrasonication at different combinations of temperatures (40, 60 and 80 °C) and time (1–6 h). Analyses of soluble oxalate were carried out using Ultra High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (UHPLC). Among six calcium sources, CaSO<inf>4</inf>.2H<inf>2</inf>O and high-calcium milk were the most effective treatments that reduced 31.78 % and 21.14 % soluble oxalate in cocoa powder, respectively. Ultrasonication reduced up to 39.96 % soluble oxalate in cocoa powder, but the efficiencies greatly depended on temperatures, durations and the interactive effects between the two factors. It was concluded that the addition of calcium using its salts or milk products and ultrasonication were potential methods to reduce soluble oxalate and make cocoa powder safer for consumers at risks of hyperoxaluria. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to collect information on the bacterial resistance to antibiotics of bacteria isolated from urine cultures of patients treated for upper urinary tract calculi. Data of patients with urinary tract infection and urolithiasis were retrospectively reviewed to collect information on age, gender, stone size, location, hydronephrosis, procedure of stone removal and antibiotic treatment, identification and susceptibility of pathogens, symptoms, and infectious complications. A total of 912 patients from 11 centers in 7 countries (Bulgaria, Greece, Italy, North Macedonia, Spain, and Turkey) were studied. Mean age was 54 ± 16 years and M/F ratio 322/590. Out of 946 microbial isolates, the most common were E. coli, Gram-positive, KES group (Klebsiella, Enterobacter, Serratia), Proteus spp., and P. aeruginosa. Carbapenems, piperacillin/tazobactam and amikacin showed low resistance rates to E. coli (2.5%, 7%, and 3.6%) and Proteus spp. (7.7%, 16%, and 7.4%), but higher rates were observed with Klebsiella spp., P. aeruginosa, and Gram-positive. Fosfomycin had resistance rates less than 10% to E. coli, 23% to KES group, and 19% to Gram-positive. Amoxicillin/clavulanate, cephalosporins, quinolones, and TMP/SMX showed high resistance rates to most bacterial strains. High rates of antibiotic resistance were observed in patients candidate to stone treatment from South-Eastern Europe. The empirical use of antibiotics with low resistance rates should be reserved to the most serious cases to avoid the increase of multidrug resistant bacteria. Basing on our results, carbapenems, piperacillin/tazobactam, and amikacin may be a possible option for empiric treatment of urinary stone patients showing systemic symptoms. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Mediastinal parathyroid carcinoma (PC) is a rare entity in primary hyperparathyroidism. The aim of this report is to demonstrate a case of mediastinal PC, and to provide a systemic literature review of this rare condition. A 34-year-old woman who had already undergone two cervical operations for hyperparathyroidism suffered from another recurrence, presenting with recurrent acute pancreatitis and persistent hypercalcemic crisis. Technetium-99 methoxyisobutylisonitrile imaging (MIBI) and computed tomography scanning (CT) identified three possible parathyroid tumors, one of which was the recurrence of residual tumor locating in the thyroid region, while the other two were ectopic tumors locating in the suprasternal fossa and thymus region, respectively. Pathological examination confirmed the diagnosis of PC. We conducted a systemic literature review by searching the PubMed MEDLINE from 1951 to 2019 for studies of all types in the English language only, using terms “mediastinal, mediastinum, parathyroid, carcinoma.” Including our reported case, a total of 21 cases with ectopic mediastinal PCs were assessed for demographic data, tumor location and size, biochemical findings, and symptomatology, etc. Two thirds of the patients were men, with a mean age of 44 years old, a mean serum calcium of 14.2 mg/dl, and a mean serum intact parathyroid hormone of 1,216 pg/ml. We identified 89.5% of carcinomas in the anterosuperior mediastinum, and 10.5% in the middle mediastinum, with a mean diameter of 54 mm, and a mean weight of 216 g. MIBI and CT were the most commonly used methods to localize these mediastinal tumors, with 69.2 and 100% sensitivity, respectively. Half of the patients underwent more than one operation. Diagnosis and treatment of mediastinal PCs represent a challenge. Early suspicion, appropriate preoperative localization studies, and the cooperation of endocrinologists and surgeons are crucial in the effective management. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Urinary calcium (Uca) levels in space reflect bone loss and kidney stone risk and could be measured using portable devices. This project evaluated the repeatability of Uca measurements to assess how many repeated measurements would be needed to detect significant urinary calcium elevations in space. METHODS: A total of six subjects collected 24-h urine samples weekly for 8 wk and took 500 mg of oral calcium carbonate and 400 IU of vitamin D daily in week 7 and 8. Uca concentration was analyzed using a calcein-based system. The effect of the intake of calcium and vitamin D on Uca levels and the correlation between first void concentration and 24-h mass were assessed with linear mixed effect models. The reproducibility coefficient (RPC) for Uca was determined using Bland-Altman analysis on pairs of measurements at different time points. RESULTS: Oral supplementation did not significantly affect 24-h mass. First void concentration correlated with 24-h mass. The 24-h mass RPCs were 167.0, 116.8, and 108.1 mg for 1-, 2-, and 3-wk average measurements. First void concentration RPCs were 90.6, 76.6, and 72.8 mg · L-1. Skylab astronauts 24-h mass increased by 88.9 ±76.0, 123.5 ± 58.3, 142.2 ± 56.5, and 159.9 ± 83.4 mg after 1, 2, 3, and 4 wk in flight. DISCUSSION: Averaging multiple Uca measurements reduced variability effectively and allowed increases likely to be seen in space to be detected. Consecutive Uca measurements could be tracked over time in space to assess the effectiveness of the countermeasure program. First void concentration could potentially be used rather than 24-h collections. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - This case report records an obstructive urolithiasis due to a large calcium carbonate urethral stone in an 11-year-old Arabian stallion. The stallion had colicky pain, anuria, and reduction in food and water intakes. Palpation of the penis revealed rhythmic contractions of the urethra, a hard mass in the penile urethra at the level of the ischial arch, and a dilated urethra proximal to the mass. Rectal examination revealed a distended and turgid urinary bladder. Passing a urethral catheter revealed a complete urethral obstruction at the level of the ischial arch. Ultrasonography revealed a calculus that appeared as an irregular, hyperechoic arch-like thick line with acoustic shadowing. Subischial urethrotomy was conducted under epidural anesthesia. Uneventful recovery was seen with no recurrence or complications for 12 months of available follow-up. In conclusion, clinical, rectal, and ultrasound examinations are valuable for definite diagnosis of urethral calculi in horses and the subischial urethrotomy appears to be successful in correcting this condition in horses. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Recent data have suggested that bariatric procedures, especially laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (SG), are safe and effective weight loss measures in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). But most of the studies have looked at short-term outcomes, and there is a general lack of awareness of underlying disease processes and baseline comorbidities in IBD patients undergoing bariatric procedures. Postbariatric issues in IBD patients including diarrhea from dumping syndrome, choleretic diarrhea, a high prevalence of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, gastroesophageal reflux disease, Barrett's esophagus, stomal ulcerations, stenosis, and renal and gallstones can complicate the natural history of IBD. This could lead to unnecessary hospitalizations, change of medical therapy, and poor surgical and quality of life outcomes. In this review, we will discuss major complications after common bariatric procedures (SG, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, and gastric banding) and suggest possible management strategies. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Objectives: To determine if alternative alkalinizing agents lead to similar changes in 24-hour urine pH and citrate compared to potassium citrate (KCIT). Many stone formers cannot tolerate KCIT due to side effects or cost. In these patients, we have prescribed potassium bicarbonate or sodium bicarbonate as alternative alkali (AA), though their efficacy is unclear. Methods: We performed a retrospective cohort study of adult stone formers seen from 2000 to 2018 with 24-hour urine analyses. Two analyses were performed. The first evaluated the alkalinizing and citraturic effects in patients with baseline low urine pH or hypocitraturia off of any alkalinizing medications, who were subsequently treated with either KCIT or AA. The second analysis compared the pH and citrate in patients changing from KCIT to an AA. Reasons for switching were abstracted by chart review and cost savings percentages were calculated using GoodRx medication prices. Results: When starting alkali therapy, the median increase in pH from baseline was 0.64 for KCIT and 0.51 for AA (P = .077), and the median increase in citrate from baseline was 231 mg for KCIT and 171 mg for AA (P = .109). When switching alkali therapy, median pH and citrate did not significantly change. Hyperkalemia (24%), GI upset (19%), and cost (17%) were the most common reasons cited for switching to an AA. AA represented a savings of 86%-92% compared to KCIT. Conclusion: Alternative alkali appear to offer comparable improvements in 24-hour urine parameters and significant cost-savings compared to KCIT. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Introduction: Urolithiasis is a widespread health problem with a high recurrence and is a clinical condition that can progress to renal failure. This study aimed to investigate whether Ononis spinosa L. has a litholytic effect on kidney stones with different chemical patterns. Materials and methods: Urinary stones extracted from seven patients over 18 years of age during surgery were used as the study material. Each urinary stone was divided into two parts, one of which was left in a solution prepared with O. spinosa L. and the other constituted the control sample. The amount of calcium, phosphor and uric acid passing through each solution was detected by spectrophotometric analysis to assess its efficiency and determine whether or not the urinary stones were dissolved in the solution. The chemical compositions of the urinary stones were analyzed using reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the litholytic effect of O. spinosa L. on kidney stones. Results: The passage of calcium, phosphate and uric acid through the solution containing O. spinosa L. was found to be statistically significant by spectrophotometry (p < 0.05) for all seven kidney stone samples left in the solution, and it was observed that the dissolution rates of the four stones with uric acid were higher than others. Conclusion: The results of this study showed that O. spinosa L. may have a litholytic effect on kidney stones. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Felty’s syndrome (FS) is a deforming disease, characterized by the triad of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), neutropenia, and splenomegaly. Currently, FS patients are treated mainly with immunosuppressants, such as methotrexate and glucocorticoids, which however are not suitable to some patients and may cause severe side effects. Here we report a clinical FS case that was treated with Tocilizumab (TCZ) successfully. The patient had symmetrical swelling and pain of multiple joints, deformity of elbow joints with obvious morning stiffness. Joint color Doppler ultrasound showed synovial hyperplasia and bone erosion of wrist and proximal interphalangeal joints and CT scan suggested splenomegaly. Further examination showed neutropenia and anemia, a high titer of anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody, rheumatoid factor and anti-nuclear antibodies, positive p-ANCA, and elevated IgA and IgG. After treating with TCZ, the patient has been relieved of clinical symptoms. His spleen has recovered to normal size. The absolute neutrophil count (ANC) tended to be stable, and joint erosion did not deteriorate. We have reviewed the literatures on FS treatment with biological agents and found only a few reports using TNF-α antagonist and rituximab treating FS, but none with TCZ. So, it is the first time to report a successful FS case treated with TCZ. This case suggests that the TCZ may be a new choice for FS treatment, under the condition of closely monitoring the ANC. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Oxalate is a common constituent of kidney stones, but the mechanism of its transport across epithelia is not well understood. With prior research on the role of the intestine focused on mammals, the present study considered oxalate handling by teleost fish. Given the osmotic challenge of seawater (SW), marine teleosts have limited scope for urinary oxalate excretion relative to freshwater (FW) taxa. The marine teleost intestine was hypothesized as the principal route for oxalate elimination, thus demanding epithelial secretion. To test this, intestinal 14C-oxalate flux was compared between FW- and SW-acclimated sailfin molly (Poecilia latipinna). In SW, oxalate was secreted at remarkable rates (367.90±22.95 pmol cm-2 h-1), which were similar following FW transfer (387.59±27.82 pmol cm-2 h-1), implying no regulation by salinity. Nevertheless, this ability to secrete oxalate at rates 15-19 times higher than the mammalian small intestine supports this proposal of the teleost gut as a major, previously unrecognized excretory pathway. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Milk of calcium is a viscous colloidal suspension of calcium salts that forms in dilated cysts or cavities. We present, for the first time in literature, a toddler with isolated milk of calcium and treated with a conservative approach. A boy with a history of one urinary tract infection and recurrent fever without vesicoureteral reflux showed at the age of 14 months a left obstructive staghorn stone. Because of absent function of the left kidney at mercapto acetyl tri glycine scintigraphy, a JJ stent was positioned with a leak of whitish material immediately after the stent positioning. Renal scintigraphy performed 1 month later revealed a partial resumption in renal function (18%). When he was 18 months old, the child suffered episodes of acute pain with inconsolable crying, unresponsive to paracetamol administration. Ultrasound assessment revealed left pelvic dilation (anterior-posterior diameter of 18 mm), suspended echogenic debris in the bladder, and dilated left distal ureter with particulate matter. These episodes of acute pain were followed by expulsion of numerous soft formations and emission of greenish urine. Both urine culture at the admission and culture on the greenish urines were sterile. After the expulsion of the soft formations, pain episodes stopped. The diagnosis of milk of calcium stone was made. With this case, we highlight a condition that can be easily diagnosed (if known) because the morphology of the expelled material is pathognomonic. Diagnosing it could avoid unnecessary treatments (ie, extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy) and support a conservative approach (ie, stent positioning). © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients have a higher risk of cardiovascular (CVD) morbidity and mortality compared to the general population. The links between CKD and CVD are not fully elucidated but encompass both traditional and uremic-related risk factors. The term CKD-mineral and bone disorder (CKD-MBD) indicates a systemic disorder characterized by abnormal levels of calcium, phosphate, PTH and FGF-23, along with vitamin D deficiency, decreased bone mineral density or altered bone turnover and vascular calcification. A growing body of evidence shows that CKD patients can be affected by subclinical vitamin K deficiency; this has led to identifying such a condition as a potential therapeutic target given the specific role of Vitamin K in metabolism of several proteins involved in bone and vascular health. In other words, we can hypothesize that vitamin K deficiency is the common pathogenetic link between impaired bone mineralization and vascular calcification. However, some of the most common approaches to CKD, such as (1) low vitamin K intake due to nutritional restrictions, (2) warfarin treatment, (3) VDRA and calcimimetics, and (4) phosphate binders, may instead have the opposite effects on vitamin K metabolism and storage in CKD patients. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Bariatric surgery (BS) is one of the most common and efficient surgical procedures for sustained weight loss but is associated with long-term complications such as nutritional deficiencies, biliary lithiasis, disturbances in bone and mineral metabolism and an increased risk of nephrolithiasis, attributed to urinary metabolic changes resultant from low urinary volume, hypocitraturia and hyperoxaluria. The underlying mechanisms responsible for hyperoxaluria, the most common among all metabolic disturbances, may comprise increased intestinal oxalate absorption consequent to decreased calcium intake or increased dietary oxalate, changes in the gut microbiota, fat malabsorption and altered intestinal oxalate transport. In the current review, the authors present a mechanistic overview of changes found after BS and propose dietary recommendations to prevent the risk of urinary stone formation, focusing on the role of dietary oxalate, calcium, citrate, potassium, protein, fat, sodium, probiotics, vitamins D, C, B6 and the consumption of fluids. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Aciduria caused by urinary excretion of acidic metabolic wastes produced in daily life is known to be augmented in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). To evaluate the reno-protective effect of oral alkalizing agents for the improvement of metabolic acidosis and neutralization of intratubular pH in the patients with mild stages of CKD. Also, to identify reno-protective surrogate markers in the serum and urine that can closely associate the effect of urine alkalization. Methods: In this single-centered, open-labeled, randomized cohort study, patients with CKD stages G2, G3a and G3b, who visited and were treated at Tohoku University Hospital during the enrollment period were registered. We administered sodium bicarbonate or sodium-potassium citrate as the oral alkalinizing agents. A total of 150 patients with CKD will be randomly allocated into the following three groups: sodium bicarbonate, sodium-potassium citrate and standard therapy group without any alkalinizing agents. The data of performance status, venous blood test, spot urine test, venous blood-gas test, electrocardiogram, renal arterial ultrasonography and chest X-ray will be collected at 0, 6, 12 and 24 weeks (short-term study) from starting the interventions. These data will be also collected at 1 and 2 years (long-term study). The samples of plasma and serum and early-morning urine at every visit will be acquired for the analysis of renal function and surrogate uremic biomarkers. The recruitment for this cohort study terminated in March, 2018, and the follow-up period for all the enrolled subjects will be terminated in December, 2020. The primary endpoint will be the development of originally-defined significant renal dysfunction or the occurrence of any cerebrovascular disease in the short-term study. The secondary endpoint will be the same endpoints as in the long-term study, or the patients with significant changes in the suggested the surrogate biomarkers. Discussion: The findings of this study will address the importance of taking oral alkalizing agents in the patients with early stages of CKD, furthermore they could address any new surrogate biomarkers that can be useful from early stage CKD.

AB  - Nephrogenic adenoma is a rare benign urinary tract lesion. There are pediatric cases that have been managed with intravesical sodium hyaluronate, but there are no published adult cases. We present the first case of an adult successfully treated with intravesical sodium hyaluronate without resection. A 77-year-old man was investigated with cystoscopy for lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) unresponsive to medical therapy. This revealed multifocal flat black bladder lesions. Biopsy showed the lesions to be nephrogenic adenoma. His LUTS were treated with 6 weeks of intravesical sodium hyaluronate. He returned 6 weeks later for resection of his bladder lesions. However, resection was abandoned as the bladder lesions had entirely resolved. The resolution of the bladder lesions following intravesical sodium hyaluronate was unexpected but does agree with existing literature. The two reported pediatric cases also suggest that intravesical sodium hyaluronate is therapeutic for nephrogenic adenoma. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - In the present study, the thermal and structural properties of a kidney stone, which was passed out of the body naturally by a 29-year-old woman who was 4 months pregnant, were investigated by using the experimental analysis methods of the differential thermal analysis (DTA), thermogravimetric analysis (TG) and X-ray diffraction. The DTA and TG analyses were taken in the temperature range of 25–1000 °C. After reaching the temperature of 680 °C, the decomposition of calcium carbonate to calcium oxide was detected. In the TG curve, the total mass loss of 26.2% was detected. The as-used kidney stone is fully composed of the single phase of calcium oxalate monohydrate (C<inf>2</inf>H<inf>2</inf>CaO<inf>5</inf>), also known as the whewellite, with the tetragonal crystal structure. The crystallinity percent of the as-used kidney stone was found to be 91.3%. The crystallite size was computed to be 107.22 ± 4.79 nm and 79.69 ± 3.63 nm from Scherrer and Williamson–Hall equations, respectively. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Idiopathic kidney stones originate mainly from calcium phosphate deposits at the tip of renal papillae, known as Randall's plaques (RPs), also detected in most human kidneys without stones. However, little is known about the mechanisms involved in RP formation. The localization and characterization of such nanosized objects in the kidney remain a real challenge, making their study arduous. This study provides a nanoscale analysis of the chemical composition and morphology of incipient RPs, characterizing in particular the interface between the mineral and the surrounding organic compounds. Relying on data gathered from a calculi collection, the morphology and chemical composition of incipient calcifications in renal tissue were determined using spatially resolved electron energy-loss spectroscopy. We detected microcalcifications and individual nanocalcifications found at some distance from the larger ones. Strikingly, concerning the smaller ones, we show that two types of nanocalcifications coexist: calcified organic vesicles and nanometric mineral granules mainly composed of calcium phosphate with carbonate in their core. Interestingly, some of these nanocalcifications present similarities with those reported in physiological bone or pathological cardiovascular biominerals, suggesting possible common formation mechanisms. However, the high diversity of these nanocalcifications suggests that several mechanisms may be involved (nucleation on a carbonate core or on organic compounds). In addition, incipient RPs also appear to present specific features at larger scales, revealing secondary calcified structures embedded in a fibrillar organic material. Our study proves that analogies exist between physiological and pathological biominerals and provides information to understand the physicochemical processes involved in pathological calcification formation. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Objective: To describe the treatment of goats with urethral obstruction secondary to urolithiasis by combining tube cystostomy and urethrotomy. Animals: Eight male goats. Study design: Short case series. Methods: Medical records (September 2012–September 2017) of male goats treated for obstruction secondary to urolithiasis with tube cystostomy and urethrotomy were reviewed. Data collected included signalment, history, physical examination findings, diagnostic results, perioperative treatments, operative details, hospitalization duration, intraoperative and postoperative complications, urolith analysis, and time to restoration of urethral patency. Long-term follow-up (>12 months) was obtained by email or telephone interviews of owners or by clinical examination. Results: Seven of eight goats were castrated males of various of breeds. All goats were tachycardic with urethral pulsation at admission. Uroliths were composed of calcium carbonate in four goats and silica in one goat. All goats regained urethral patency during hospitalization, and all were discharged alive from the hospital. Seven goats were alive at long-term follow-up. Postoperative complications included persistent urethral obstruction requiring a second urethrotomy 2 days postoperatively, premature dislodgement of the bladder catheter and jejunal obstruction secondary to adhesions, and recurrence of obstructive urolithiasis within the proximal perineal urethra requiring a second surgery 8 months later (1 each). Long-term outcome was good, with urethral patency beyond 12 months in six of eight goats. Conclusion: Combining tube cystostomy and urethrotomy restored urethral patency in goats with urethral obstruction from uroliths. Although none of the complications seemed directly related to the urethrotomy, formation of abdominal adhesions and recurrence of urolithiasis affected long-term outcomes. Clinical significance: Uroliths that do not dissolve in acidic urine may be more frequent in some practices. The combined approach of tube cystostomy and urethrotomy appears to successfully restore urethral patency with promising long-term outcomes. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Infectious urinary stones induced to grow by urease-producing bacteria consist of aggregates of bacteria, highly crystalline struvite, and poorly crystalline and amorphous precipitate (PCaAP). The paper describes an experimental study on the influence of (-)-epicatechin, a green tea component, on the nucleation and growth of PCaAP. The crystallization process of PCaAP was performed in artificial urine, and the activity of bacteria was simulated by the addition of aqueous ammonia solution. The formation of struvite was avoided by using Mg-free artificial urine. Optical microscopy methods and spectrophotometric measurements both confirm that (-)-epicatechin promotes the nucleation and growth of PCaAP. This means that PCaAP nucleation is shifted toward a lower pH compared to the control test. The results of the experiments are explained based on the theoretical analysis of the chemical species formed in artificial urine. This chemical speciation analysis shows that the experimentally observed effects are due to the effect of (-)-epicatechin on the formation of CaCO<inf>3</inf>, CaHPO<inf>4</inf>, CaC<inf>2</inf>O<inf>4</inf>, CaCit-, and HPO<inf>4</inf> 2- species. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Urolithiasis is an important disease of farm animals and a few cases are reported in camels. Camel is an animal that anatomically and physiologically adapted itself to the weather condition of the desert. This investigation was undertaken to study the prevalence of urolithiasis, the clinical features and determination of prognostic factors in camel with acquired urinary obstruction in Djanet province from southeastern Algeria. Therefore, of the 62 male dromedary camels, 5 were intact and 57 were castrated; uroliths were found in 10 castrated and 1 intact male with urinary calculi incidence of 17.74%. Male dromedary camels were presented with a history of urine retention. Anamnesis revealed a 3 to 6-day history of lethargy, loss of appetite, oligodipsia and repetitive unsuccessful attempts at micturition. Six animals were completely obstructed, and clinical evolution was finished by death after anuria and coma. This survey showed 11 urinary stones in eleven 7-12 years old male camels. Six urinary stones of nonsurvivor camels were studied. The diameter of the stones varied between 0.2 × 0.3 to 0.8 × 0.9 mm, with average weight of 0.15 to 0.65-gram, rough or smooth surface and every stone was cream in color. Urinary stones might be known as calcite (Calcium carbonate). The degree of obstruction (partial / total) and the ruptured bladder (yes / no) increase the risk of mortality in clinically ill animals by presenting a statistically significant link. Other risk factors studied such as age, race, rupture of the urethra, treatment strategy and season of admission have no statistically significant relationship (P> 0.05) and do not affect the survival of animals. To our knowledge, this is the first description of urolithiasis in the dromedary camel from Algeria. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Background/Aims: Direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) have been approved for hepatitis C virus (HCV) treatment in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis. Nevertheless, the complicated comedications and their potential drug-drug interactions (DDIs) with DAAs might limit clinical practice in this special population. Methods: The number, class, and characteristics of comedications and their potential DDIs with five DAA regimens were analyzed among HCV-viremic patients from 23 hemodialysis centers in Taiwan. Results: Of 2,015 hemodialysis patients screened in 2019, 169 patients seropositive for HCV RNA were enrolled (mean age, 65.6 years; median duration of hemodialysis, 5.8 years). All patients received at least one comedication (median number, 6; mean class number, 3.4). The most common comedication classes were ESRD-associated medications (94.1%), cardiovascular drugs (69.8%) and antidiabetic drugs (43.2%). ESRD-associated medications were excluded from DDI analysis. Sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir had the highest frequency of potential contraindicated DDIs (red, 5.6%), followed by glecaprevir/pibrentasvir (4.0%), sofosbuvir/ledipasvir (1.3%), sofosbuvir/velpatasvir (1.3%), and elbasvir/grazoprevir (0.3%). For potentially significant DDIs (orange, requiring close monitoring or dose adjustments), sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir had the highest frequency (19.9%), followed by sofosbuvir/ledipasvir (18.2%), glecaprevir/pibrentasvir (12.6%), sofosbuvir/velpatasvir (12.6%), and elbasvir/grazoprevir (7.3%). Overall, lipid-lowering agents were the most common comedication class with red-category DDIs to all DAA regimens (n=62), followed by cardiovascular agents (n=15), and central nervous system agents (n=10). Conclusions: HCV-viremic patients on hemodialysis had a very high prevalence of comedications with a broad spectrum, which had varied DDIs with currently available DAA regimens. Elbasvir/grazoprevir had the fewest potential DDIs, and sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir had the most potential DDIs. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Antacids are usually alkaline substances that are used to neutralise excess acid in the stomach. Antacids were developed based on the hydroxides and carbonates of the group II and III metals, as well as the bicarbonates of the alkali metals. Antacids can be classified into two main classes being non-absorbable or absorbable antacids. Non-absorbable antacids have fewer side effects and further advantageous properties. Each antacid has a specific active ingredient which has a different effect on the gastric acid. Antacids act similar to when an acid reacts with a hydroxide; a salt and water are produced. Antacids are more effective in the form of suspension. The average therapeutic dose of an antacid is 10–15 ml of liquid or one to two tablets three to four times a day. These drugs have small volumes of distribution, undergo minimal hepatic metabolism and are excreted in faeces. Antacids that contain calcium, magnesium and aluminium ions are chelators. To avoid undesirable interactions, antacids are usually used two hours before or after taking any medication. Stress ulcerations are common in intensive care unit (ICU) patients. The pathophysiology of the ulceration probably results from an imbalance between mucosal protection and gastric acid hypersecretion. Whilst prophylaxis was provided to every patient previously, it is wise to individualise the decision and to only provide it to high risk patients. For critically ill patients who are able to receive enteral medications and in whom prophylaxis is indicated, an oral proton pump inhibitor (PPI) is preferred rather than an alternative prophylactic agent. For critically ill patients who cannot receive enteral medications, an intravenous (IV) histamine 2 (H<inf>2</inf> ) receptor blocker or IV PPI can be administered. Where PPIs or H<inf>2</inf> blockers cannot be administered, sucralfate is a suitable oral alternative. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Objectives: Urinary tract stones are a common public health problem worldwide. In addition, identifying the composition of stones is important for the further metabolic evaluation of patients. We conducted this study to further correlate the relationship between body mass index (BMI) and different compositions of urinary tract stones. Materials and Methods: A retrospective study of 433 patients who underwent urinary tract stone analysis via Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy at King Khalid University Hospital in Riyadh from May 2015 to June 2017 was performed. Their BMI at the time of stone analysis was recorded. Results: A total of 433 stones were analyzed by the statistical data analysis software. The BMI was classified according to the WHO classification. We divided our patients into seven age groups. Most patients were between the age group of 35 and 44 years and were overweight. The incidence of calcium oxalate, carbonate apatite, and uric acid stones was higher in patients with a BMI above thirty than in patients with a lower BMI. However, cystine stones were more common in normal-weight patients. Conclusions: In this study, we found that the incidence of certain types of stones, such as calcium oxalate, cystine, and uric acid stones, in Saudi Arabia can be predicted by BMI measurement. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Introduction: Kidney stones affect 1 in every 11 people in the United States each year. There is a significant high recurrence rate without a stone prevention protocol. Alkali citrate is beneficial in decreasing stone recurrence, but because of the cost and gastrointestinal side effects there is a low adherence rate. This study aims to serve as a review of some of the most commonly used alkalizing over-the-counter supplements that are advertised to prevent and treat kidney stones. Methods: Data were gathered by a comprehensive online literature search and company inquiries for kidney stone prevention supplements. An additional informal poll of the authors selected supplements that are most commonly taken by their patients. A total of eight supplements were evaluated for cost, alkali equivalent provided, dosing, and regulatory information. Results: Eight of the most commonly used supplements were reviewed with a focus on alkalizing agents. Information reviewed revealed dosing recommendations resulting in decreased citrate alkali equivalents per day compared with prescription-strength potassium citrate. Cost, peer-reviewed study results, and regulatory data were reviewed, tabulated, and analyzed. Cost per alkali equivalent was substantially decreased for each supplement compared with the prescribed drug. All supplements were found to be readily available online. Conclusion: Over-the-counter alkalizing agents are available to patients and may be an appropriate alternative to cost-prohibitive potassium citrate when treating urolithiasis patients. Additional testing will be necessary in the future to determine the efficacy of these supplements in the treatment and prevention of urinary stone disease. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Present study is aimed to explore the rapid and reliable method of analyzing the composition of concentric layers of stones by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy with Kidney Stone Library Software (KSLS-13). Total of 69 kidney stones recovered from kidney stone patients (33 males and 36 females, mean age ranges of males and females were 10.1 to 37.3 & 15.2 to 54.4 respectively) were analyzed by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Composition of central, middle, peripheral layers of each kidney stone and whole stone were analyzed in the research laboratory of Institute of Biochemistry. Spectra of layers of kidney stones were collected and compared with kidney stone library software (KSLS-13). Among 69 kidney stones, 25 (36.2%) were pure stones (23.2% pure Calcium oxalate mono hydrate (COM), 10% pure carbonate apatite (CA), 3% pure magnesium ammonium phosphate (MAP)) and 44 (63.7%) mixed stones. Among 69 kidney stones, most prevalent were pure calcium oxalate stones (23.2%) and calcium oxalate mono hydrate stones mixed with carbonate apatite and ammonium hydrogen urate (AHU) (18.8%). The IR bands were compared with KSLS-13 as well as with standards. Calcium oxalate mono hydrate, carbonate apatite and uric acid were significantly increased in middle layer, but ammonium hydrogen urate and calcium oxalate dihydrate (COD) were increased in periphery. Whereas, reverse was true for magnesium ammonium phosphate in central layer. In conclusion, KSLS-13 by FTIR is found to be the most rapid and reliable method to study composition of concentric layers of kidney stones. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The present study investigated the prevalence of uroliths in fattening pigs and assessed the composition of these urinary tract concrements. In total, 2,432 urinary bladders were sampled in the slaughterhouse and checked for abnormal content. Urinary samples were analysed microscopically, and samples of the urinary bladder wall were tested for histological signs of inflammation. The composition of the concrements was examined by infrared spectrophotometry. Macroscopic and microscopic abnormalities were detected in 8.4% and 52.8% of the samples respectively. Magnesium ammonium phosphate (struvite), calcium oxalate dihydrate (COD), calcium carbonate (calcite), calcium oxalate monohydrate (COM) and amorphous crystals were detected. Analysis of stones showed COD in all samples in different proportions. The calcium content of examined stones was always considerable (up to 34%), in contrast to the magnesium content which represented max 1.9%. Struvite was found in one third of the samples, but was never part of stones and grit. COD crystals were the second most common microscopic crystal. These COD crystals and some COD stones had a rectangular shape, and therefore, they can be harmful to the bladder mucosa. In conclusion, uroliths are present in a large proportion of male fattening pigs, and consequently, urinary concrements pose a life-threatening risk for urethra obstruction in male pigs. Further research is warranted to identify potential risk factors for urolithiasis and microscopic crystals. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Background. The incidence of adrenal incidentaloma has been increasing proportional to the use of radiologic examination. Multiple endocrine neoplasia1 (MEN1) syndrome may present with various tumors. The present study reports a case of adrenal incidentaloma with unrecognised MEN1 syndrome associated with breast cancer. Clinical case. A 48-year-old woman presented with a 2.4cm left adrenal incidentaloma on abdominal computed tomography. Her history revealed primary amenorrhea, recurrent peptic ulcer and nephrolithiasis. Laboratory and radiologic examination revealed two pancreatic tail mass lesions with markedly elevated gastrin levels (1462 pg/mL), hypercalcemia with increased parathyroid hormone levels (72 pg/mL), a 1.5cm pituitary mass with hyperprolactinemia (234 ng/mL), a 1.0cm meningioma and a nonfunctional left adrenal mass. During this image work up, a 0.6cm nodule in the right breast was incidentally detected. Surgeries (laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy, parathyroidectomy and wide local excision of breast) and pathologic findings confirmed pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, parathyroid gland hyperplasia, and breast cancer. Carbergoline treatment for 12 months decreased prolactin levels to 27 ng/mL. Genetic testing using peripheral blood revealed a pathogenic variant in MEN1 on chr11q13 (NM_000244.3:c.1365+1_1365+11 del, GTGAGGGACAG, heterozygous). Conclusion. Considering the increasing incidence of adrenal incidentaloma and 20% prevalence of adrenal tumors in patients with MEN1, it is important to rule out MEN1 association in patients with adrenal incidentaloma. Additionally, breast cancer was detected during MEN1 work-up in this case. Female patients with MEN1 are at increased risk for breast cancer. Therefore, intensified breast cancer screening at a relatively young age should be considered in female MEN1 patients. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Purpose: Half of hormone receptor-positive (HR+) breast cancer patients will develop joint pain, termed aromatase inhibitor-induced arthralgia (AIA), while taking aromatase inhibitor therapy. Though there is no universally accepted effective treatment for AIA, there has been some evidence to support high-dose vitamin D as a treatment. Methods: We randomized post-menopausal women who were beginning adjuvant AI therapy to receive standard-dose vitamin D3 (800 IU daily for 52 weeks), or high-dose vitamin D3 (50,000 IU weekly for 12 weeks, followed by 2000 IU daily for 40 weeks). The primary end point was development of AIA. The trial was designed to enroll 184 patients. This futility analysis was performed after 93 patients were enrolled. Results: The high-dose vitamin D regimen was effective in raising serum vitamin D levels, but there was no significant difference in development of AIA between the two arms. In the high-dose arm, 25 patients (54%) developed AIA, compared to 27 patients (57%) in the standard-dose arm. The planned futility analysis was positive; thus, the study was terminated. Neither baseline vitamin D nor 12-week vitamin D level was predictive of AIA development. Conclusion: Although vitamin D levels were increased in the high-dose arm, there was no significant signal for benefit of high-dose vitamin D supplementation for AIA prevention in this unblinded trial. This study, along with several others, implies that vitamin D likely does not play a significant role in AIA for the majority of patients. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Adequate daily calcium intake should normally be achieved by dietary sources. Since low calcium diets are quite common in subjects that do not reach the recommended intake and particularly those at risk of fractures, calcium supplements may become necessary. Different forms of calcium salts are available, but products containing calcium citrate and calcium carbonate complexes are the most frequently used. Although only limited evidence on the efficacy and long-term safety of calcium citrate is available, these supplements may represent a valuable product for the management of different chronic pathological conditions. The aim of this review was to evaluate the current and potential clinical applications of calcium citrate. In particular, we focused on the use of calcium citrate supplementation in subjects with osteoporosis or in bariatric patients. Other pathological conditions that could benefit calcium citrate supplementation may include achloridria, chronic hypoparathyroidism and hypocitraturic subjects with moderate/high risk of nephrolithiasis. Indeed, citrate salts are widely used in the treatment of nephrolithiasis, since they have shown an inhibitory effect on kidney stone formation and recurrence. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Hungry Bone Syndrome (HBS) refers to rapid, profound, and prolonged hypocalcemia associated with hypophosphatemia and hypomagnesemia occurring in patients with increased bone turnover after successful management of the underlying disorder. We describe a male patient with primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT), in whom HBS was diagnosed 6 months after parathyroidectomy. Histopathologic examination revealed an atypical parathyroid adenoma (APA), while immunohistochemistry showed cell proliferation index Ki-67 10% and overexpression of cyclin D1 (>90%). Preoperative treatment with vitamin D3 had normalized 25OHD and alkaline phosphatase levels, reflected in an improvement in bone turnover prior to surgery. Postoperative treatment for HBS with alfacalcidol, calcium, vitamin D3 and magnesium was administered for a long period. This treatment prevented severe postoperative hypocalcemia and he was discharged two days later. Preoperative cinacalcet treatment did not reduce hypercalcemia implying that the tumor had lack of calciumsensing receptors (CaSR). In conclusion, preoperative restoration of low 25OHD levels is essential for prevention of HBS. Postoperative treatment with active metabolites of vitamin D must be initiated as early as possible, in order to prevent or minimize the development of HBS, and to reduce the duration of hospitalization. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The process of destroying kidney stones using ultrasonic waves at certain frequencies has long been known in the medical field. The process of granular destruction using ultrasonic waves is very possible to produce a very fine grain size due to the large number of micro bubbles from the cavitation effect on the ultrasonic probe. The purpose of this research is to determine the effect of alcohol media in the destruction of calcium carbonate granules by ultrasonic waves to obtain carbonate calcium with nano-sized particles. The alcohol used in this study was 2-butanol, Ethylene glycol and n-propanol. The raw material of calcium carbonate was calcium carbonate precipitates originating from the Bayat region, Klaten Regency, Central Java, which was processed first by the carbonation method into calcium carbonate precipitates. The best result of experiments on the destruction of precipitated calcium carbonate by ultrasonic waves was the use of ethylene glycol media with ultrasonic time of 10 minutes and 30% amplitude. The result of the particle size analysis (PSA) at the best condition obtained with the average size of the granules of calcium carbonate precipitate was 72 nm. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - We report a case of a staghorn stone containing ammonium acid urate that was effectively treated with drug therapy alone. A 46-year-old man had recurring urinary tract stones. He had no previous episode of urinary tract stones that required hospitalization and operation. He received only drug therapy for hyperuricemia in another hospital. Ultrasonography and computed tomography revealed a left staghorn stone measuring 37 x 34 mm. The kidney-ureter-bladder radiograph did not show any stones. His urine was acidic, and we estimated that the left staghorn stone consisted of urate. Oral administration of sodium hydrogen carbonate was initiated to alkalize the urine, and treatment with transurethral lithotripsy (TUL) was scheduled. Before the TUL, analysis of an excreted stone sample revealed that it consisted of ammonium acid urate. The staghorn stone was completely removed in 10 months after the first medical examination. At present, the patient is free of urinary tract stones. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - A five-year-old female spayed Vietnamese potbellied pig was evaluated due to a chronic history of dysuria and pollakiuria as well as lack of faecal output for one week. Physical examination revealed vitals within normal parameters and to facilitate further workup evaluation, the patient was anaesthetized. Complete blood count and chemistry panel values were unremarkable. Ultrasonography of the bladder indicated the presence of uroliths, and this was confirmed with abdominal radiographs. A cystotomy was performed to remove the uroliths, and an enaema was administered to relieve the constipation. The patient recovered from anaesthesia uneventfully and was discharged after four days of hospitalisation. Analysis revealed that the stones were composed of calcium phosphate carbonate; husbandry and medical management changes were implemented to prevent reoccurrence. Urolithiasis is an uncommon finding in female pigs; this case report describes a comprehensive clinical workup and treatment of a female adult pig with urolithiasis. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Obesity is a serious health challenge worldwide and is associated with various comorbidities, including dyslipidemia, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. Developing effective strategies to prevent obesity is therefore of paramount importance. One potential strategy to reduce obesity is to consume calcium, which has been implicated to be involved in reducing bodyweight/fat. In this review, we compile the evidence for the anti-obesity roles of calcium in cells, animals, and humans. In addition, we summarize the possible anti-obesitymechanisms of calcium, including regulation of (a) adipogenesis; (b) fat metabolism; (c) adipocyte (precursor) proliferation and apoptosis; (d) thermogenesis; (e) fat absorption and excretion; and (f) gut microbiota. Although the exact anti-obesity roles of calcium in different subjects and how calcium induces the proposed anti-obesity mechanisms need to be further investigated, the current evidence demonstrates the anti-obesity effects of calcium and suggests the potential application of dietary calcium for prevention of obesity. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The present study aimed to investigate the chemical composition of urinary calculi in people living in the northern border area of Saudi Arabia and to formulate suggestions for prevention of renal stones. Urinary stones were obtained from patients attending the Urology Departments of Prince Abdul Aziz Bin Musaad Hospital and Central Hospital, Arar, Saudi Arabia. Stones were analyzed using kit for semi-quantitative colorimetric determination of carbonate, calcium, magnesium, ammonium, oxalate, phosphate, uric acid and cysteine; manufactured by LTA s.r.l. Milano 15/F, 20060 Bussero (Milano), Italy. From a total of 55 urinary stones, 49 (89%) were retrieved from males, while 6 (11%) from females. Ages of patients ranged from 15 to 75 years with the mean of 50.22±14.46 and majority of patients were between 31-50 years (69.08%). Most of the patients were overweight (70.91 %) in both the genders. Calcium oxalate stones were 60%, uric acid 18.18% and calcium phosphate 10.90%, while other forms of stones were scarce. It is concluded that upper urinary tract stones were predominant, comprising mostly of calcium oxalate and urate, which could be prevented by control of obesity; moderate intake of meat, dairy products, fruit vegetables (with minimal oxalates); and plenty of fluids. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Oral calcium salts are recommended for the treatment of chronic hypoparathyroidism (HypoPT), although dosimetry is variable between individual patients and clinicians. However, patient feedback on calcium salts can be negative, particularly due to gastrointestinal side effects and hypercalciuria-related complications. We begin with a clinical case of a HypoPT patient taking oral calcium salts following thyroid surgery, who requested support in reducing her dose of these with a view to stopping entirely. To evaluate her request, we first describe the usual treatment of HypoPT according to current guidance and then present data from (a) a case note review of a cohort of 24 HypoPT patients managed with a “no calcium” treatment regimen by single physician (b) a comprehensive online survey of HypoPT patients’ treatment and experiences (n = 330). The case note review found that target range serum calcium levels were successfully achieved in all 24 patients since transitioning to a “no calcium” regimen, without any breakthrough hypocalcaemia-related symptoms, the development of new renal stones, the occurrence of calcium-related hospital admissions or the finding of significant hypercalciuria. The online survey identified 36% of HypoPT patients who continued to take activated vitamin D, but had discontinued calcium supplements. HypoPT patients not currently taking calcium reported a significantly lower prevalence of adverse effects and outcomes, both compared with their previous experiences whilst taking calcium and also compared with the 64% of patients who continued to take oral calcium. We conclude that, subject to methodological limitations, there are significant issues of tolerability arising from conventional calcium-based treatment regimens for patients with chronic HypoPT. For selected patients, it may be reasonable to facilitate a managed therapeutic transition to “no calcium” regimen, and we also propose that calcium-based regimes be prospectively evaluated against calcium-free (or calcium-low) alternatives. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - In rats, we recently showed how a chronic metabolic acidosis simultaneously reduced urinary oxalate excretion and promoted oxalate secretion by the distal colon leading to the proposition that acid–base disturbances may trigger changes to renal and intestinal oxalate handling. The present study sought to reproduce and extend these observations using the mouse model, where the availability of targeted gene knockouts (KOs) would offer future opportunities to reveal some of the underlying transporters and mechanisms involved. Mice were provided with a sustained load of acid (NH <inf>4</inf> Cl), base (NaHCO <inf>3</inf> ) or the carbonic anhydrase inhibitor acetazolamide (ATZ) for 7 days after which time the impacts on urinary oxalate excretion and its transport by the intestine were evaluated. Mice consuming NH <inf>4</inf> Cl developed a metabolic acidosis but urinary oxalate was only reduced 46% and not statistically different from the control group, while provision of NaHCO <inf>3</inf> provoked a significant 2.6-fold increase in oxalate excretion. For mice receiving ATZ, the rate of urinary oxalate excretion did not change significantly. Critically, none of these treatments altered the fluxes of oxalate (or chloride) across the distal ileum, cecum or distal colon. Hence, we were unable to produce the same effects of a metabolic acidosis in mice that we had previously found in rats, failing to find any evidence of the ‘gut-kidney axis’ influencing oxalate handling in response to various acid–base challenges. Despite the potential advantages offered by KO mice, this model species is not suitable for exploring how acid–base status regulates oxalate handling between the kidney and intestine. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The goal was to test whether stone composition and kidney phantom configuration affected comminution in extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy (SWL) laboratory tests. Confinement may enhance the accumulation of dust and associated cavitation bubbles in the fluid surrounding the stone. It is known that high shockwave delivery rates in SWL are less effective because bubbles generated by one shockwave do not have sufficient time to dissolve, thereby shielding the next shockwave. Materials and Methods: Experiments were conducted with a lithotripter coupled to a water bath. The rate of comminution was measured by weighing fragments over 2 mm at 5-minute time points. First, plaster and crystal stones were broken in four phantoms: a nylon wire mesh, an open polyvinyl chloride (PVC) cup, a closed PVC cup, and an anatomical kidney model - the phantoms have decreasing fluid volumes around the stone. Second, the fluid volume in the kidney model was flushed with water at different rates (0, 7, and 86 mL/min) to remove dust. Results: The efficiency of breakage of stones decreases for the dust emitting plaster stones (percentage of breakage in 5 minutes decreased from 92% ± 2% [n = 3] in wire mesh to 19% ± 3% [n = 3] in model calix) with increasing confinement, but not for the calcite crystal stones that produced little dust (percentage of breakage changed from 87% ± 3% [n = 3] in wire mesh to 81% ± 3% [n = 3] in kidney model). Flushing the kidney phantom at the fastest rate improved comminution of smaller plaster stones by 27%. Conclusions: Phantoms restricting dispersion of dust were found to affect stone breakage in SWL and in vitro experiments should replicate kidney environments. The dust around the stone and potential cavitation may shield the stone from shockwaves and reduce efficacy of SWL. Understanding of stone composition and degree of hydronephrosis could be used to adapt patient-specific protocols. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Objectives: Super-refractory status epilepticus (SRSE) is one of the most challenging issues in intensive care units (ICUs) in that it is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Although the ketogenic diet (KD) has been reported to be effective in treating of SRSE, the use of the diet as therapy can be complicated by concomitant medical problems specific to critically ill patients. In this study, we aimed to describe our experience of the KD for SRSE patients in ICUs. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 16 patients (10 males, 6 females) with SRSE who were treated with the KD in the ICUs at Samsung Medical Center from July 2005 to July 2017. Results: The median age of seizure onset was 8 years (interquartile range 5–13.5). Prior to diet initiation, the patients were in convulsive or non-convulsive SRSE for a median of 23 days (range, 3–420). The median time to achieve ketosis was 3 days (range, 2–6). The KD was continued for a median of 2.1 months (range, 0.1–15.8). Of the 16 patients, nine (56.3%) achieved seizure freedom, six (37.5%) reported >50% seizure reduction, and one (6.2%) had <50% seizure improvement after the KD. There was no significant change in the number of antiepileptic drugs. The most commonly encountered complication during the KD was gastrointestinal disturbance. Conclusions: Our experience indicates that the KD is an effective alternative therapeutic strategy for SRSE patients in ICUs with adequate efficacy and safety in reducing seizure frequency and weaning from prolonged mechanical ventilation, although functional outcome was not favorable for most patients. Close monitoring and preventive management of potential adverse effects are critical elements for success with the KD in patients with SRSE. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Purpose: Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is a common endocrine disorder and is usually diagnosed in adults. PHPT due to ectopic parathyroid adenoma in adolescents is rare. Methods: We describe the case of a 15-year-old boy with PHPT due to ectopic parathyroid adenoma. A review of the literature of PHPT in adolescents was performed, focusing on etiology, clinical presentation, preoperative localization methods, pathology, and treatment. Results: The patient was successfully treated with surgery and was followed up for 5 years with no signs or symptoms of hyperparathyroidism. By reviewing the literature, only seven cases of PHPT associated with ectopic parathyroid lesions in adolescents have been reported. Parathyroidectomy is the only known curative treatment. Accurate preoperative localization of the target lesion is critical. Conclusions: This study should raise awareness of the diagnosis and treatment of PHPT due to ectopic parathyroid adenoma/carcinoma in adolescents. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Hypoparathyroidism is a relatively rare endocrine disease characterised by either null or inappropriately low secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH) for serum calcium levels. The other main laboratory findings include hypocalcaemia, inappropriately normal or high urine calcium excretion and hyperphosphataemia with low urine phosphate excretion. The management of hypoparathyroidism should be tailored to each individual case, which makes it a demanding undertaking in everyday clinical practice. In this review, we sought to focus on the diagnostic approach of hypoparathyroidism and the therapeutic challenges of the disease from a clinical perspective. Conventional treatment with vitamin D analogues and calcium salts is no longer the only available treatment, since replacement treatment with PTH(1-84) has recently been approved for the disease. However, the optimal treatment schedule is yet to be defined. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Purpose: Incidence of pediatric urolithiasis is decreasing in most developing countries where endemic bladder stones are less prevalent than in the past years. In parallel, stone composition has changed. Only few data are available in North Africa, except for Tunisia. We report stone composition in the Moroccan pediatric population. Material and methods: Composition of 432 stones from children (302 boys, 130 girls) was determined by infrared spectroscopy. The samples were collected during the period 1999–2016. Stone morphology, which is an important aspect for etiology was determined by examination of each stone under a stereomicroscope. Stone composition was compared to patients’ age and gender. Results: The global male-to-female ratio was 2.32. Regarding stone composition, calcium oxalate was the main component in 51.6% of the stones, followed by struvite (18.1%), ammonium urate (9.5%) and carbapatite (9%). Significant differences were found between males and females: calcium oxalate accounted for 72.3% of stones in girls and 42.7% in boys (P < 10−6); conversely, struvite was more frequent in boys than in girls (22.2 vs 8.5%, P < 10−4). The same was found for calcium phosphate stones (11.9% in boys; 4.6% in girls, P < 0.05). Stone morphology helped us for detecting several pathological conditions: type Ic whewellite stones, as a marker for primary hyperoxaluria, was found in 17.6% of stones and type IIId ammonium urate stones, suggestive for infectious diarrhea, was identified in 20.1% of all stones. Conclusion: This is the largest series of pediatric stones in Morocco studied by infrared analysis and morphological examination. Level of evidence: 3.; Objectif. — L’incidence de la lithiase pédiatrique a diminué dans la plupart des pays en développement avec une réduction des lithiases vésicales endémiques. Parallèlement, la nature des calculs évolue. Peu de données existent dans le Maghreb en dehors de la Tunisie. Nous rapportons l’expérience marocaine à partir de 432 calculs d’enfants. Matériel et méthodes. — L’analyse morpho-constitutionnelle des calculs de 302 garçons et 130 filles âgés de 0 à 17 ans a été réalisée par un examen stéréomicroscopique et analyse infrarouge. Les calculs ont été collectés entre 1999 et 2016. Les résultats ont été analysés selon le sexe et l’âge des enfants. Résultats. — Le rapport garçons/filles était de 2,32. L’oxalate de calcium était le composant principal de 51,6 % des calculs, suivi par la struvite (18,1 %), l’urate d’ammonium (9,5 %) et la carbapatite (9 %). L’oxalate de calcium représentait 72,3 % des calculs chez les filles et 42,7 % chez les garçons (p < 10−6) ; à l’inverse, la struvite était plus fréquente chez les garçons que chez les filles (22,2 vs 8,5 %, p < 10−4). De même, pour les calculs phosphocalciques (11,9 % chez les garc¸ons, 4,6 % chez les filles; p < 0,05). La morphologie des calculs a permis de détecter plusieurs pathologies lithogènes : les calculs de whewellite de type Ic, marqueur des hyperoxaluries primaires, ont été observés dans 17,6 % des cas ; les calculs d’urate d’ammonium de morphologie IIId, suggérant des diarrhées infectieuses, ont été identifiés dans 20,1 % des cas. Conclusion. — Cette étude représente la plus grande série de calculs pédiatriques analysés au plan morphoconstitutionnel au Maroc. Niveau de preuve. — 3. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Background:Prevalence of osteoporosis and fracture is increased among older people with HIV. We compared the effects of low (1000 IU) vs moderate (3000 IU) vitamin D3 (VitD) supplementation on areal bone mineral density (aBMD) and volumetric bone mineral density (vBMD) in African American and Hispanic postmenopausal women with HIV on antiretroviral therapy.Methods:We performed a 12-month prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study with primary outcomes of change in aBMD by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and secondary outcomes of change in vBMD by quantitative computed tomography and bone turnover markers. An intent-to-treat analysis was performed on 85 randomized subjects (43 low and 42 moderate) for primary DXA outcomes, and complete case analysis was performed for secondary outcomes.Results:Mean age was 56 ± 5 years, median CD4 count was 722 cells/mm3, and 74% had HIV RNA ≤ 50 copies/mL. Serum 25-OHD was higher in the moderate than low VitD group at 6 months (33.1 ± 10.3 vs 27.8 ± 8.1 ng/mL, P = 0.03) and 12 months, but parathyroid hormone levels remained similar. Percent change in aBMD, vBMD, and bone turnover markers did not differ between low and moderate VitD groups before or after adjustment for baseline aBMD.Conclusions:VitD supplementation at 3000 IU daily increased mean total 25-OHD levels in postmenopausal women with HIV, but we did not find evidence of an effect on BMD beyond those observed with 1000 IU daily. Future studies are necessary to determine whether VitD supplementation is beneficial in this patient population, and if so, what dose is optimal for skeletal health. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Purpose:We prospectively assessed the efficacy and the predictors of the success of oral dissolution therapy by alkalization for lucent renal calculi.Materials and Methods:Patients with radiolucent renal stones were counseled to undergo oral dissolution therapy, which entails oral potassium citrate 20 mEq 3 times daily, 3 L daily fluid intake and a dietary regimen. The study primary end point was the achievement of a 6-month stone-free rate with oral dissolution therapy. The other end point was a change in stone surface area as measured by noncontrast computerized tomography at 3 and 6 months.Results:Between February 2015 and January 2016 only 182 of the 212 eligible patients who agreed to participate were compliant with oral dissolution therapy and included in the final analysis. Mean stone surface area at enrollment was 1.3 cm2 (range 0.16 to 11.84). At 3 months 97 (53.2%), 65 (35.7%) and 20 (11.1%) patients were oral dissolution therapy responders (stone-free), partial responders and nonresponders, respectively. Oral dissolution therapy achieved a 6-month stone-free rate of 83%, including 97 and 54 patients after 3 and 6 months of oral dissolution therapy, respectively. On regression analysis the initial 3-month response to oral dissolution therapy (p = 0.001), lower stone density (p = 0.03) and higher urine pH 12 weeks after treatment (p = 0.01) independently predicted the oral dissolution therapy response at 6 months.Conclusions:Regardless of stone size, oral dissolution therapy was an effective treatment approach for lucent renal stones. The initial response to oral dissolution therapy after 3 months was the key factor in determining the potential oral dissolution therapy response after 6 months. In addition, treatment compliance in achieving the targeted urine pH and low stone density has an independent role in the oral dissolution therapy response. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Struvite kidney stones are rare but may cause significant morbidity and mortality. Therapy remains primarily surgical, but combined treatment with antibiotics is now common. Pharmacologic dissolution therapy has been applied successfully, but the side effects of currently available drugs are significant, limiting their use. Struvite stones are strongly associated with genitourinary infection and urinary stasis, but metabolic abnormalities may coexist and formal metabolic evaluation may be useful in some cases. New treatments with a renewed emphasis on hybrid and non-surgical dissolution therapies are being investigated. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Obstructive urinary tract disease in horses is a rare and low prevalence pathology in the species, but potentially severe. It is an emergency condition that presents variable clinical signs and depends on the anatomical location of the obstruction. The bladder calculus are the most common followed by the urethra and less commonly seen are the kidney or ureteral. The main crystalloid component of uroliths in horses is calcium carbonate. The higher prevalence of urolithiasis in male horses is justified by some anatomical differences between genders. The urethra of males is narrower and longer than that of females. The tissue injury is the most important factor for the development of uroliths in horses. Desquamation of epithelial cells, presence of leukocyte and necrotic cell debris are relevant contributors to crystal growth. Urinary stasis favors nucleation by increasing the chance of contact between crystalloid material and urinary epithelium. Once crystal growth has begun, the urine alkalinity of the equines favors the crystallization and further deposition of other components, especially calcium carbonate. Typical clinical signs of urolithiasis include tenesmus, dysuria, strangury and polaquiuria. Hematuria is often present, mainly observed after exercise and at the end of urination. In addition signs of colic are quite frequent in the acute bladder and urethral urolithiasis due to bladder distension. Upper urinary tract surgery may be technically challenging due to limited structural exposure, especially in adult horses The prognosis for horses with urolithiasis depends on the location of the urolith and the degree of renal injury that occurred. Case: This report aims to describe a rare case of obstructive urolithiasis in a 8-year-old castrated male horse with 24 h evolution. The horse was expressing signs of abdominal pain and during the transretal examination through palpation, it was possible to notice great distension and turgidity of the bladder, in addition to a high pain sensitivity to the palpation of the kidneys. Was perform urethral catheterization, but it was unproductive. The diagnosis was made through perineal ultrasonography and treated surgically by perineal urethrotomy. The animal presented an excellent evolution after being discharged after 10 days of hospitalization and did not present any complication or recurrence of the disease after one year of the procedure. Discussion: Urolithiasis in horses has a prognosis dependent on the location of the urolith and the degree of renal damage. Cases of obstructive urolithiasis in horses are rare and require prompt and appropriate intervention. Therefore, a rapid and accurate diagnosis is directly related to the success of the treatment. In the present case, the animal had characteristic clinical signs of an acute abdomen. Transrectal palpation, for evaluation of the intestinal portions, was important to diagnose an excessively distended urinary vesicle with no intestinal changes. Transcutaneous ultrasonography of the perineum allowed visualization of the calculus, and then a case of perineal urolithiasis was diagnosed. The choice for perineal urethrotomy was performed because of the ease of palpation of the calculus through the skin below the anus and because it is a non-invasive technique. The urethra was sutured to guide the cicatricial process and the urethral catheter was maintained, reducing the risks of occlusion of the urethral lumen. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Bilateral nephrolithiasis with a concurrent vaginal calculus was identified in a stranded free-ranging long-beaked common dolphin Delphinus capensis. Necropsy and radiologic examinations of the sexually mature D. capensis revealed multiple small irregularly round nephroliths and a 6.4 × 4.1 × 9.2 cm vaginal calculus weighing 182 g. Nephroliths numbered 68 and 71 in the left and right kidneys, respectively, and ranged from 1.7 to 6.9 mm in diameter. Nephroliths were composed of 100% ammonium urate, which has been found in captive dolphin populations. However, the vaginolith consisted of struvite and calcium carbonate suggesting an alternate etiology. The composition of the vaginolith suggests that bacterial vaginitis could have served as the predisposing condition. Renal lesions included chronic tubulointerstitial nephritis with tubular degeneration and loss, likely secondary to the nephroliths. The pathogenesis of ammonium urate nephrolithiasis in managed care is suspected to be linked to diet and age but in this case may be due to metabolic disruption. However, if environmental changes cause a shift in prey species, the risk of nephrolithiasis in free-ranging cetaceans could increase. Careful surveillance for nephroliths in free-ranging populations should be considered by researchers. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Obstructive urolithiasis is a disease characterized by the presence of uroliths in the urinary tract, with consequent obstruction of excretion pathways. This paper described the epidemiological and clinical-pathological findings of 22 outbreaks of urolithiasis in growing finishing pigs in Southern Brazil. All affected pigs were male and clinical presentation consisted of lethargy, dysuria, rectal prolapse, abdominal distention, peripheral cyanosis and reluctance to move. Clinical progression course ranged from 12 hours to one week, and the lethality rate was 100%. Gross changes were characterized by urinary bladder rupture associated with marked amount of yellowish liquid with ammoniacal odor (urine) in the abdominal cavity (uroperitoneum), as well as mild fibrin deposition on the surface of abdominal organs and hydronephrosis. Urinary uroliths ranging from 0.3 to 1cm in diameter were often observed obstructing the lumen of the penile urethra and sometimes those were free in the abdominal cavity. Histopathological findings included diffuse and marked urinary bladder edema and hemorrhage associated with inflammatory infiltrate of lymphocytes, plasma cells, and macrophages. Diffuse and marked necrosis of the mucosal epithelium was observed in the penile urethra. Intense fibrin deposition and inflammatory infiltrate of neutrophils were noted in the peritoneum, as well as in the serosa of the organs in the abdominal cavity. Uroliths were submitted to the method of qualitative determination of the mineral components, and were compatible with calcium carbonate and magnesium ammonium phosphate. Growing pigs ration analysis revealed low levels of calcium in relation to phosphorus, resulting in a Ca:P ratio of approximately 0.35:1. Histological findings and mineral analysis suggest that outbreaks of urolithiasis were related to a nutritional imbalance in the proportions of dietary calcium and phosphorus. The main cause of mortality was related to dehydration and uroperitoneum. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Acute abdomen in pregnancy represents a unique diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. Acute abdominal pain in pregnancy can occur due to obstetric factors as well for reasons that are unrelated to pregnancy. The diagnostic approach of acute abdomen during pregnancy can be tricky owing to the altered clinical presentations brought about by the anatomical and physiological changes of gestation along with the reluctance to use certain radiological investigations for fear of harming the fetus. Delay in diagnosis and treatment can lead to adverse outcomes for both the mother and fetus. In this article, we attempt to review and discuss the various etiologies, the current concepts of diagnosis, and treatment, with a view to developing a strategy for timely diagnosis and management of pregnant women presenting with acute abdominal pain. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Introduction: Hyperoxaluria is a common abnormal finding in patients with nephrolithiasis, especially in children in contrary to adults. Overall, it is a rare disorder with the four main types of primary, enteric, dietary and idiopathic. The disorder is characterized by overproduction of oxalate that leads to nephrocalcinosis and eventual development of end-stage renal failure. Case Presentation: We report the case of a 2-year-old boy presented with multiple episodes of seizure, gastrointestinal bleeding, loss of consciousness and rise in blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine (Cr). He underwent imaging study and lumbar puncture with the suspicion of encephalitis. With more history-taking, we understood that he was previously under treatment for nephrocalcinosis. Finally, he underwent dialysis and the level of consciousness improved. His diagnosis was confirmed by renal biopsy and establishing the existence of extensive tubular and interstitial crystal deposition in his kidneys. Conclusions: The case illustrates the need for the early diagnosis of this disorder to prevent systemic oxalosis that affects many organs resulting in severe morbidity and mortality and raising the suspicion of primary hyperoxaluria in childhood progressive renal failure with massive nephrocalcinosis, especially if accompanied by a positive family history. In these cases, complications should be explained to increase drug compliance. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Objective: It is anticipated that an intake of vitamin D found acceptable by Endocrine Society Guidelines (10 000 IU/day) with co-administered calcium supplements may result in frequent hypercalciuria and hypercalcaemia. This combination may be associated with kidney stones. The objective of this study was to compare the episodes of hypercalciuria and hypercalcaemia from calcium supplements co-administered with 10 000 IU or 600 IU vitamin D daily. This design allows a comparison of the Institute of Medicine recommendation for the RDA of vitamin D along with the upper limit of calcium intake with the high intake of vitamin D suggested by the Endocrine Society. Context: Harms of currently recommended high intake of vitamin D have not been studied. Design: The design was a randomized controlled trial with 2 groups with evaluation every 3 months for one year: (a) CaCO<inf>3</inf> 1200 mg/day with 10 000 IU vitamin D<inf>3</inf>/day or (b) CaCO<inf>3</inf> 1200 mg/day with 600 IU vitamin D<inf>3</inf>/day. Patients: This study was conducted in an ambulatory research centre in healthy, white postmenopausal women. Measurements: Serum and 24-hour urine calcium were measured. Results: Hypercalcaemia and hypercalciuria occurred in both groups. At the final visit, 19/48 in the high dose D group had hypercalciuria. The odds of developing hypercalciuria were 3.6 [OR = 3.6(1.39, 9.3)] times higher in the high dose D group. The odds of developing hypercalcaemia did not differ between groups. Conclusions: The safe upper level of vitamin D recommended by the Endocrine Society when accompanied by calcium supplements results in frequent hypercalciuria. The risk of kidney stones at these levels should be investigated. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Purpose: Medical treatment of osteoporosis should preferably be both effective and have minimal side effects. The aim of the present study was to examine long-term benefits and risks of parathyroid hormone (PTH) treatment in compliant patients. Methods: This is a nationwide retrospective cohort study based on national registers in which we identified 1739 patients treated with PTH (2003–2010) (index cases) for at least 18 months and with a medication possession rate of > 0.8. For comparison, patients treated with bisphosphonate (BP) (n = 13,131) and anti-osteoporotic treatment-naïve controls (n = 12,721) were selected. Incidence of fractures, drug consumption, and comorbidity were compared between the three cohorts. Mean follow-up of the PTH-treated patients was 4.3 years (range 1.8–8.7 years). Results: Before initiation of treatment, PTH patients had a significantly higher Charlson comorbidity index score and more osteoporotic fractures than both BP patients and controls. No difference was detected in the incidence of fractures during PTH treatment or years after between PTH patients and BP patients. No significant difference in the use of drugs was seen between PTH and BP patients, except for PPI intake which was higher in PTH patients. No significant increases were found in the incidence of cancers or other ICD-10 diagnoses among PTH-treated patients in comparison with both BP and controls. Conclusion: Overall, PTH treatment is effective and safe. Following PTH treatment in compliant patients, neither fracture incidence nor drug consumption differed between PTH-treated and BP-treated patients, despite the fact that PTH-treated patients had more severe osteoporosis. No increased incidence of malignant diseases or other diseases was detected. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Rationale: Hypophosphatasia is an inborn error of metabolism that can appear any time in life, mainly with bone manifestations due to low alkaline phosphatase activity. Asfotase alfa is a specific enzyme reposition treatment that has shown promising results in children; however, there are few reports about the outcomes in adult patients. Patient concerns: A 36-year-old male presented with an early history of craniosynostosis, short stature, and multiple fractures since the age of 13 years-which needed numerous surgical corrections. He was admitted with a previous diagnosis of osteogenesis imperfecta, taking alendronate, calcium carbonate, cholecalciferol, and calcitriol. Bone mineral density was low (lumbar spine Zscore= 3.0 SD), with impairment of all parameters of high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT). Kidney impairment was also observed with reduced creatinine clearance, nephrolithiasis, and nephrocalcinosis. Diagnosis: Alkaline phosphatase was unexpectedly low (6 U/L, reference value: 30-120U/L), with high serum vitamin B6 (260 mcg/L, reference value: 5.2-34.1). Genetic testing showed a homozygous missense mutation in ALPL gene c.443 CT: p.Thr148Ile. Intervention: Asfotase alfa was requested due to important bone deterioration, ambulatory disability, and kidney impairment. It was given subcutaneously 2 mg/kg per dose, 3 times a week, for 12 months before reassessment. Outcomes: Bone mineral densities of the lumbar spine and whole body, besides almost all HR-pQCT microstructural parameters of the distal tibia, showed improvements and the patient was able to walk without assistant device. Kidney function did not further deteriorate. Lessons: Hypophosphatasia should be considered as a differential diagnosis in young patients with multiple fractures and kidney impairment, since the use of antiresorptive drugs, calcium and vitamin D, commonly used to treat fractures, worsen its symptoms and prognosis. A 12-month asfotase alfa treatment improved bone density and structural parameters even in an adult patient with late diagnosis. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Calcium is a macroelement that is part of the mineral composition of the diet of companion animals, and is considered a cation of strong alkalizing power, increasing urinary pH. Calcium salts have different solubilities and depending on the anion to which calcium is associated with, it can be more or less absorbed, modifying the pH of the urine. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficiency of calcium sources on alkalinization of urinary pH, as well as excretion of urinary electrolytes and acid-base balance of adult cats. An extruded diet for cats was selected, and had 160mEq/kg of calcium from the sources of either calcium carbonate (CaCO<inf>3</inf>) or calcium gluconate (C<inf>12</inf>H<inf>22</inf>CaO<inf>14</inf>) added. In the control treatment there was no addition of calcium sources, resulting in three treatments. Nine adult cats were used, mixed breed, in two experimental periods, with six replicates per treatment. Animal average age was 4±1.3 years old and average weight was 3.96±0.71kg. The cats remained in metabolic cages for an adaptation period of seven days, followed by six days of urine total collection, with volume, density, pH and calcium concentration (g/d) measurements. The acid-base balance was studied by blood gas analysis of venous blood. The two sources of calcium alkalinized the urine (P<0.001). However, calcium gluconate had less alkalinization power compared to the calcium carbonate (P<0.05). Urinary calcium was not affected by treatments, and represented less than 0.5% of calcium intake. The experiment showed that calcium, although an alkaline cation and considered strong influencer of the EB of the diet, cannot be evaluated individually, because depending on its associated anion it may have greater or lesser influence on cats urine pH. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Two sets of Ni-substituted calcium phosphate were synthesized by precipitation method at pH = 7 and at two different concentrations of ion carbonate (CO<inf>3</inf> 2-) in solution and Ni(II) concentrations lower than 15%. The produced solids were characterized by chemical analysis, infrared spectroscopy, x-ray powder diffraction and scanning electron microscopy. The solid samples obtained at low concentration of CO<inf>3</inf> 2- (5%) and Ni(II) concentrations 5%, 10% and 15% were synthesized at 25 and 37 °C. All solids showed the presence of a stable and crystalline brushite (CaHPO<inf>4</inf>·2H<inf>2</inf>O). The samples synthesized in presence of high levels of carbonate (50%) and Ni(II) concentration 5% at 25, 37 and 100 °C vary with temperature. Those obtained at the lower temperatures (25 and 37 °C) showed coexistence of two phases: a crystalline CaCO<inf>3</inf> and carbonate apatite with low crystallinity. At 100 °C, only carbonate apatite could be recognized. Data supported the carbonate substitution by OH- (position A) and PO<inf>4</inf> 3- (position B) in the hydroxyapatite structure. The comparison of the chemical analysis results of both systems studied (Ni,Ca) apatite and (Ni,Ca) carbonate apatite evidences a rise of Ni(II) incorporation in the apatite lattice, with simultaneous inclusion of CO<inf>3</inf> 2- and temperature increase. The obtained results suggest that brushite kidney stones development may be induced by the presence of traces of Ni(II) and simultaneous decrease of carbonate levels in the biological fluids. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Pseudohypoparathyroidism (PHP) is a rare group of disorders characterised by end-organ resistance to the parathyroid hormone (PTH). A 16-year-old boy presented with a 2-year history of involuntary dystonic movements involving mainly the left hand, initially after writing and later during physical exercise. Serum calcium was 1.37 mmol/L (2.20–2.69), phosphate 2.1 mmol/L (0.8–1.45) and PTH 302 ng/L (12–88). CT scan of the head demonstrated multiple subcortical and diffuse basal ganglia calcifications. Genetic analysis confirmed a methylation defect in the GNAS cluster on chromosome 20q13.32 which established the diagnosis. Treatment with calcitriol and calcium carbonate led to complete remission of symptoms. Causes of hypocalcaemia should be considered in evaluating patients with movement disorders. The diagnosis of PHP-1B is challenging but the overall prognosis is excellent. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is the 7th most frequently encountered disorder in cats in general practice in England,with a disease prevalence of 30–80% in cats over 10 years old, (Calcitonin Response to Naturally Occurring Ionized Hypercalcemia in Cats with Chronic Kidney Disease).The aim of the study isto show the method of phosphate binders administration in stage 3of chronic renal failurein cats.For the study, 40 cats with idiopathic chronic renal failure were selected. Cats of the first group (n = 10) received Almagel NEO as a phosphate binder, for 30 days, for the next 60 days there was no treatment with phosphate binders. Cats of the second group were given a feed supplement Ipakitine for 90 days. Animals of the third group (n = 10) received Ipakitine and Almagel NEO for 30 days and then only Ipakitine for 60 days; the fourth group (n = 10) served as a control and did not receive phosphate binders. To assess the results obtained, the animals were subjected to urinalysis and serum chemistry.Joint application of Ipakitine and Almagel NEO preparations against a low-protein diet makes it possible to improve the filtration capacity of the kidneys, which clearly indicates in changes in the urinalysis. Based on clinical and morphological studies, the method is proved and the effectiveness of the combined use of phosphatebinders Ipakitine and Almagel NEO is proved on the background of a low-protein diet for the long-term correction of hyperphosphataemia in the in stage 3 of chronic renal failure in cats.In connection withthe characteristic picture of chronic dystrophic and destructive processes in the kidneys, changes in full blood count, chemistry and urinalysis values under the influence of phosphatebinders, used in doses of 34 mg of an algebra (0.5 ml of Almagel NEO) per 1 kg of body weight twice a day and 1 g preparation Ipakitine for 5 kg of body weight of an animal 2 times a day are detected. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Calcium is vital for life, and extracellular calcium concentrations must constantly be maintained within a precise concentration range. Low serum calcium (hypocalcemia) occurs in conjunction with multiple disorders and can be life-threatening if severe. Symptoms of acute hypocalcemia include neuromuscular irritability, tetany, and seizures, which are rapidly resolved with intravenous administration of calcium gluconate. However, disorders that lead to chronic hypocalcemia often have more subtle manifestations. Hypoparathyroidism, characterized by impaired secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH), a key regulatory hormone for maintaining calcium homeostasis, is a classic cause of chronic hypocalcemia. Disorders that disrupt the metabolism of vitamin D can also lead to chronic hypocalcemia, as vitamin D is responsible for increasing the gut absorption of dietary calcium. Treatment and management options for chronic hypocalcemia vary depending on the underlying disorder. For example, in patients with hypoparathyroidism, calcium and vitamin D supplementation must be carefully titrated to avoid symptoms of hypocalcemia while keeping serum calcium in the low-normal range to minimize hypercalciuria, which can lead to renal dysfunction. Management of chronic hypocalcemia requires knowledge of the factors that influence the complex regulatory axes of calcium homeostasis in a given disorder. This chapter discusses common and rare disorders of hypocalcemia, symptoms and workup, and management options including replacement of PTH in hypoparathyroidism. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Pediatric urolithiasis remains endemic in low-resource countries where infants constitute 17–40% of all children with urolithiasis. This study reports socio-economic factors, medical history and chemical composition of urinary stones in 976 infants of up to 2 years of age. Between 1992 and 2016, 976 infants presented to our institute with 1038 stones. Chemical composition of stones was analyzed by Fourier transformation infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The mean age of infants was 19.5 ± 5.74 months with a M:F ratio of 5.5:1. Half (50%) of the infants were rural dwellers, 90% belonged to low socio-economic class and 70% were malnourished. A history of chronic diarrhoea was reported in 13% and urinary tract infections in 5%. The anatomic location was bladder in 487 (46.9%), kidney in 246 (23.6%), ureter in 142 (13.6%), urethra in 2 (0.2%) and 161 (15.5%) were passed spontaneously. Overall frequency of compounds in stones showed ammonium acid urate (AAU) in 772 (74.37%), calcium oxalate (CaOx) in 410 (39.5%). Uric acid (UA) in 119 (11.46%), calcium phosphate apatite (CaP) in 96 (9.25%), magnesium ammonium phosphate (Struvite) in 45 (4.34%), cystine in 12 (1.16%) and xanthine in 40 (3.85%). Frequency of compounds was similar in genders. Infants of age 0–6 months had higher frequency of UA (28%), CaOx (50%) and low AAU (61%) as compared to 11, 39 and 75%, respectively, in 7–24 months (p < 0.049) (p < 0.002) (p < 0.001). Nucleus of stones showed pure AAU in 63 and 43% on the surface due to addition of CaOx, struvite and CaP. Our study has shown that AAU is a major component of stones in infants where the main risk factors are poverty, malnutrition, diarrheal diseases and dehydration. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The relationship involving acid-base imbalance, mineral metabolism and bone health status has previously been reported but the efficacy of the alkalizing supplementation in targeting acid overload and preventing bone loss has not yet been fully elucidated. In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, the hypothesis that potassium citrate (K citrate) modifies bone turnover in women with postmenopausal osteopenia was tested. Three hundred and ten women were screened; 40 women met the inclusion criteria and were randomly assigned to the treatment or the placebo group. They were treated with K citrate (30 mEq day−1) or a placebo in addition to calcium carbonate (500 mg day−1) and vitamin D (400 IU day−1). At baseline and time points of 3 and 6 months, serum indicators of renal function, electrolytes, calciotropic hormones, serum bone turnover markers (BTMs) (tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase 5b (TRACP5b), carboxy-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen (CTX), bone alkaline phosphatase (BAP), procollagen type 1 N terminal propeptide (PINP)), and urine pH, electrolytes, and citrate were measured. The follow-up was completed by 17/20 patients in the “K citrate” group and 18/20 patients in the “placebo” group. At baseline, 90% of the patients exhibited low potassium excretion in 24 h urine samples, and 85% of cases had at least one urine parameter associated with low-grade acidosis (low pH, low citrate excretion). After treatment, CTX and BAP decreased significantly in both groups, but subjects with evidence of low-grade acidosis gained significant benefits from the treatment compared to the placebo. In patients with low 24h-citrate excretion at baseline, a 30% mean decrease in BAP and CTX was observed at 6 months. A significant reduction was also evident when low citrate (BAP: −25%; CTX: −35%) and a low pH (BAP: −25%; CTX: −30%) were found in fasting-morning urine. In conclusion, our results suggested that K citrate supplementation improved the beneficial effects of calcium and vitamin D in osteopenic women with a documented potassium and citrate deficit, and a metabolic profile consistent with low-grade acidosis. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - We observed earlier that mineralo-organic nanoparticles form in human body fluids when the concentrations of calcium, carbonate and phosphate exceed saturation. The particles have been shown to represent mineral precursors in developing bones and teeth as well as in ectopic calcification and kidney stones. Recent studies suggest that the mineral particles may also be involved in other physiological processes, including immune tolerance against the gut microbiota and food antigens. We review here the involvement of mineralo-organic nanoparticles in physiological and pathological processes and discuss recent findings that reveal novel and unexpected roles for these particles in the human body.

AB  - Objective: To describe the frequency, clinical profile and treatment of patients with urolithiasis in the Pediatric Nephrology Department of a public state hospital in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Methods: Retrospective study. Data from pediatric patients (age: 1 month - 18 years) with urolithiasis admitted between January/2012 and December/2014 were reviewed from hospital charts. The studied variables were: demographic and anthropometric data, clinical status, family history of urolithiasis, urinary tract infection and use of lithogenic drugs, diagnostic procedures, associated abnormalities, metabolic disorders, treatment and recurrence. Results: The frequency of urolithiasis was 13.6%. Main characteristics of the patients: male gender, white race, eutrophy, aged between 5 and 10 years, family history of urolithiasis, previous urinary infection and spontaneous stone passage. Abdominal and flank pain and macroscopic hematuria were the most common complaints. The most frequent metabolic disorders were hypercalciuria, hyperuricosuria and hypocitraturia. Hypocitraturia was associated with previous urinary infection (p=0.004). Abdomen/urinary tract ultrasonography was the most commonly used diagnostic test. Hydronephrosis occurred in 54.4% of the cases, 81.1% of the stones were in the kidneys, and bilateral stones were associated to a family history of urolithiasis (p=0.030). Recurrence rate was 29.3% (most patients had a metabolic disorder). In 12.3%, the patients underwent lithotripsy, 24.5% were surgically treated (mainly pyelolithotomy), and only 7.6% had their stones analyzed (calcium oxalate was the main finding in the examined stones). Conclusions: The frequency of urolithiasis in these pediatric patients was similar to that reported by the literature. A metabolic evaluation is required and the composition of stones should be better evaluated. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Bisphosphonates are recommended for use as first-line therapy for the prevention and treatment of glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis in adults. However, the appropriate usage of bisphosphonates for the prevention or treatment of glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis in children remains unclear. Methods: We performed a cross-sectional study to clarify the factors associated with the development of glucocorticoid-induced bone loss and osteoporosis in patients with childhood-onset rheumatic disease and to investigate the impact of the early use of alendronate. We recruited 39 patients with childhood-onset rheumatic disease who were evaluated to detect bone loss or osteoporosis at 3 months to 1.5 years after the initiation of treatment. The primary outcome of the study was the presence of bone loss or osteoporosis at the initial evaluation of the bone mineral density after at least 3 months of glucocorticoid therapy. Results: Bone loss and a history of fracture were found in 56 and 18% of the participants, respectively. Weekly oral alendronate therapy (median, 25.4 mg/m2) had been started by the time of the evaluation of osteoporosis in 46% of the participants and within 3 months after the start of glucocorticoid in 31% of the participants. There were no significant differences between the participants with bone loss (wBL group) and without bone loss (w/oBL group) in terms of gender, primary disease, or the age at the onset of primary disease. In terms of glucocorticoid use, there was no significant difference in the age at the start of glucocorticoid therapy, the length of glucocorticoid use, or the dose of glucocorticoids. The proportion of patients in the w/oBL group who received alendronate within 3 months after the start of glucocorticoid therapy was significantly greater than that in the wBL group. In the logistic regression analysis, only "alendronate therapy within 3 months after the start of glucocorticoid therapy" had a statistically significant effect on the development of bone loss (OR, 0.08; 95% CI, 0.02-0.43). The analysis did not reveal any factors associated with the development of osteoporosis. Conclusions: The early use of alendronate may have a preventive effect against the development of bone loss in glucocorticoid-treated patients with childhood-onset rheumatic disease. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Autosomal-dominant hypocalcemia with hypercalciuria (ADHH) is a genetic disease characterized by hypoparathyroidism with hypercalciuria. Most patients with ADHH have calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) gene mutations. The CaSR gene controls parathyroid secretions, and mutations in this gene can be detected via changes in serum calcium level. The activating mutation of the CaSR gene results in familial or sporadic ADHH. Most activating mutations of the CaSR gene are reportedly de novo missense mutations. This is the first case report of a novel activating variant of the CaSR gene in a neonate with congenital hypoparathyroidism with hypomagnesemia and hypercalciuria. We also report the 3-month follow-up management of the patient. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Calcium carbonate is a common urolith type in small ruminants with no high-yield experimental model to evaluate animal susceptibility or preventative measure response. Hypothesis: That novel plastic winged implants would allow accumulation and quantification of calcium carbonate calculus formation in goats on a high-calcium diet and identify individual variation between goats in the mass of calculi produced. Animals: Eight nonpregnant 3- and 4-year-old Boer-cross does, weighing 22.3–39.5 kg, determined to be healthy based on physical examination, were used in these experiments. Methods: Prospective cohort study for in vivo experimental model development. Implants were placed into the urinary bladder lumen in 8 goats over 2 evaluation periods. The alfalfa-based ration had a total ration Ca : P of 3.29 and 3.84 : 1, respectively. Urine was collected at 0, 28, 56, and 84 days in the 1st experiment; blood and urine at those timepoints in the 2nd experiment. For each evaluation period, the implants were removed 84 days after implantation and weighed. Accumulated calculi mass was calculated and compared between goats and was analyzed for composition. Results: Implant retention was 100% and 86% in the 2 studies. All goats with retained implants accumulated calcium carbonate at a mean implant gain per day across studies ranging from 0.44 to 57.45 mg. Two goats accumulated (0.44–7.65 mg/day and 33.64 & 57.45 mg/day) significantly more urolith material than the cohort across both studies (P =.047). No routine analytes on blood or urine were found to be explanatory for the difference observed. Conclusions and Clinical Importance: These findings form a basis for implant and diet selection for use in future studies of urolithiasis development and for studies regarding individual susceptibility to urolithiasis. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Introduction: Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) is characterised by a rapid reduction in the kidney function and gets effected to varying degrees based on the aetiology. An AKI increases the chances of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) if not treated properly or assessed timely. Aim: To identify the common aetiologies and to assess the prognosis and outcomes of AKI in a tertiary care centre in southern India. Materials and Methods: A retrospective observational study was conducted, in a tertiary care teaching hospital over a period of six months (August 2015 to February 2016), upon receiving approval from Institutional Ethics Committee (KH IEC 392/2015). Data of patients aged ≥18 years admitted during January-December 2012 was collected from the medical records using the ICD10 code for AKI, unspecified (N17.9). Patients with renal transplantation and chronic dialysis were excluded. Age, gender, aetiology, management, and association between treatment and outcome were analysed using descriptive statistics, univariate and multivariate logistic regression and chi square test. Results: Among 528 patients, with AKI, male predominance of 72.7% (n=384) and median {Interquartile Range (IQR)} age of 56 (20) years was observed. Prevalence of AKI was found to be 8.36/1,000 people. Community Acquired-AKI (CA-AKI) and Hospital Acquired-AKI (HA-AKI) accounted for 35% (n=185) and 65% (n=343) respectively. CKD 23% (n=79) and sepsis 22.4% (n=77) were the major aetiologies among CA-AKI whereas sepsis 49.2% (n=91) and CKD 11.9% (n=22) were the majorities among the HA-AKI. Chi square test for association between treatment and outcomes (recovery) showed a statistically significant relationship with dextrose normal saline (χ2=10.96, p<0.05), sodium bicarbonate (χ2=7.63, p<0.05), dopamine (χ2=112.14, p<0.05), calcium gluconate (χ2=17.20, p<0.05) and haemodialysis (χ2=12.13, p<0.05). Complete recovery in 64% (n=341) whereas 16% (n=82) of patients died. Conclusion: Sepsis and CKD were seen to be the leading aetiologies. Male gender with AKI is more likely to develop CKD. AKI with Diabetes Mellitus (DM), sepsis or Urinary Tract Infection (UTI) might worsen the prognosis. Fluid replenishment shows to improve the prognosis. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Urolithiasis is a common condition in both rabbits and Guinea pigs. Their particular type of calcium metabolism and other predisposing factors can lead to the formation of predominantly calcium carbonate stones in the urinary tract of these animals. Clinical signs and urinalysis can lead to a tentative diagnosis of urolithiasis. Radiographic imaging and ultrasonography are used to confirm the diagnosis. Additional blood testing can be helpful in estimating each animal's prognosis. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Introduction: We hypothesized that adding sodium bicarbonate (bicarb) to normal saline (NS) irrigation during ureteroscopy in patients with uric acid (UA) nephrolithiasis may assist in dissolving small stone fragments produced during laser lithotripsy. In vitro testing was performed to determine whether dissolution of UA fragments could be accomplished within 1 hour. Materials and Methods: In total 100% UA renal calculi were fragmented, filtered, and separated by size. Fragment sizes were <0.5 mm and 0.5 to 1 mm. Similar amounts of stone material were agitated in solution at room temperature. Four solutions were tested (NS, NS +1 ampule bicarb/L, NS +2, NS +3). Both groups were filtered to remove solutions after fixed periods. Filtered specimens were dried and weighed. Fragment dissolution rates were calculated as percent removed per hour. Additional testing was performed to determine whether increasing the temperature of solution affected dissolution rates. Results: For fragments <0.5 mm, adding 2 or 3 bicarb ampules/L NS produced a dissolution rate averaging 91% ± 29% per hour. This rate averaged 226% faster than NS alone. With fragments 0.5 to 1 mm, addition of 2 or 3 bicarb ampules/L NS yielded a dissolution rate averaging 22% ± 7% per hour, which was nearly five times higher than NS alone. There was a trend for an increase in mean dissolution rate with higher temperature but this increase was not significant (p = 0.30). Conclusions: The addition of bicarbonate to NS more than doubles the dissolution rate of UA stone fragments and fragments less than 0.5 mm can be completely dissolved within 1 hour. Addition of bicarb to NS irrigation is a simple and inexpensive approach that may assist in the dissolution of UA fragments produced during ureteroscopic laser lithotripsy. Further studies are needed to determine whether a clinical benefit exists. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Magnesium ammonium phosphate hexahydrate, called struvite, is the dominant component of infectious urinary stones. In addition to struvite, infectious urinary stones include solid phases with poor crystallinity as well as amorphous matter. This article is devoted to the analysis of these solid phases, because they have not been characterized well until now. The solid phases tested were obtained from artificial urine in the absence and presence of Proteus mirabilis. The solid phases were characterized by different techniques (X-ray Diffraction, Energy Dispersive X-ray, Scanning Electron Microscopy, as well as Raman and Infrared Spectroscopies). According to the results these phases are carbonate apatite (CA), hydroxylapatite (HAP), amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC), amorphous calcium phosphate (ACP) and/or amorphous carbonated calcium phosphate (ACCP). Carbonate apatite and hydroxylapatite may occur in non-stoichiometric forms, i.e., various anions can be substituted for CO32−, OH−, and PO43− groups in them. The non-stoichiometry of carbonate apatite and hydroxylapatite also implies a deficiency of calcium ions, i.e., calcium ions may be partially replaced by other cations. Experimental techniques and chemical speciation analysis demonstrate that the presence of magnesium influences the formation of CA and HAP. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Introduction: Struvite stones account for 15% of urinary calculi and are typically associated with urease-producing urinary tract infections and carry significant morbidity. This study aims to characterize struvite stones based on purity of stone composition, bacterial speciation, risk factors, and clinical features. Methods: Retrospective data was collected from patients diagnosed with infection stones between 2008 and 2012. Stone analysis, perioperative urine cultures, bacterial speciation, and clinical data were collected and analyzed. The purity of struvite stones was determined. Statistical comparisons were made among homogeneous and heterogeneous struvite stones. Results: From the four participating centres, 121 struvite stones were identified. Only 13.2% (16/121) were homogenous struvite. Other components included calcium phosphate (42.1%), calcium oxalate (33.9%), calcium carbonate (27.3%), and uric acid (5.8%). Partial or full staghorn calculi occurred in 23.7% of cases. Ureaseproducing bacteria were only present in 30% of cases. Proteus, E. coli, and Enterococcus were the most common bacterial isolates from perioperative urine, and percutaneous nephrolithotomy was the most common modality of treatment. Only 40% of patients had a urinalysis that was nitrite-positive, indicating that urinalysis alone is not reliable for diagnosing infection stones. The study's limitation is its retrospective nature; as such, the optimal timing of cultures with respect to stone analysis or treatment was not always possible, urine cultures were often not congruent with stone cultures in the same patient, and our findings of E. coli commonly cultured does not suggest causation. Conclusions: Struvite stones are most often heterogeneous in composition. Proteus remains a common bacterial isolate; however, E. coli and Enterococcus were also frequently identified. This new data provides evidence that patients with struvite stones can have urinary tract pathogens other than urease-producing bacteria, thus challenging previous conventional dogma. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The prevalence of kidney stones and cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are increasing throughout the world. Both diseases are chronic and characterized by accumulation of oxidized proteins and lipids in the renal tissue and arterial wall, respectively. Emerging studies have revealed a positive association between nephrolithiasis and CVDs. Based on preclinical and clinical evidences, this review discusses: (i) stone forming risk factors, crystal nucleation, aggregation, injury-induced crystal retention, and stone formation, (ii) CVD risk factors such as dyslipidemia, perturbation of gut microbiome, obesity, free radical-induced lipoprotein oxidation, and retention in the arterial wall, subsequent foam cell formation, and atherosclerosis, (iii) mechanism by which stone forming risk factors such as oxalate, calcium, uric acid, and infection contribute toward CVDs, and (iv) how CVD risk factors, such as cholesterol, phospholipids, and uric acid, contribute to kidney stone formation are described. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Calcium carbonate is an abundant biomineral that is of great importance in industrial or geological contexts. In recent years, many studies of the precipitation of CaCO<inf>3</inf> have shown that amorphous precursors and intermediates are widespread in the biomineralization processes and can also be exploited in bio-inspired materials chemistry. In this work, the thorough investigation of a urinary stone of a guinea pig suggests that amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC) can play a role in pathological mineralization. Importantly, certain analytical techniques that are often applied in the corresponding analyses are sensitive only to crystalline CaCO<inf>3</inf> and can misleadingly exclude the relevance of calcium carbonate during the formation of urinary stones. Our analyses suggest that ACC is the major constituent of the particular stone studied, which possibly precipitated on struvite nuclei. Minor amounts of urea, other stable inorganics, and minor organic inclusions are observed as well. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Urinary tract diseases are among the main reasons for consultation in veterinary clinics and hospitals. It affects animals of any age, breed and gender. Among the diseases that affect this system, urolithiasis is the second largest cause of clinical signs compatible with feline urinary tract disease. The term urolithiasis refers to the presence of uroliths in any region of the urinary tract, but it is more commonly seen in the bladder and urethra. Uroliths are classified based on the type of mineral present in their composition, therefore, quantitative and qualitative analyzes are important for a better therapeutic approach. The animals may suffer from the disease and be asymptomatic, or show nonspecific clinical signs, making the diagnosis difficult. The disease should not be seen as a single problem, but as a consequence of various disorders. As dietary, metabolic, genetic and infectious causes, as well as factors that potentiate the chance of development of uroliths such as breed, age, sex, age range, obesity, sedentary lifestyle, geographic region and climate. Thus, the knowledge of the factors that influence the formation of uroliths, as well as the understanding of the pathophysiology, are key elements for better alternatives of therapy and prevention. The recognition of these factors helps to identify susceptible populations, minimizing exposure and increasing the protection factors, which facilitates the diagnosis and treatment of patients with urolithiasis. The objective of this paper is to present the main risk factors involved in the formation of urinary lithiasis in felines. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Clinical suspicion of urolithiasis should be evaluated with low-dose computed tomography as the first-line imaging modality for nonpregnant, adult patients. A period of observation may be appropriate for ureteral stones less than 10 mm, and medical expulsive therapy may be beneficial for facilitating passage of distal ureteral stones. Regardless of stone type, patients should adhere to a low-sodium diet and attempt to achieve a urine volume of more than 2.5 L daily. Individuals with calcium stones should maintain a normal calcium diet, and if stones persist, citrate therapy or thiazide diuretics in the setting of hypercalciuria may be indicated. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - This chapter focuses on the most common exotic animal species, their common diseases, patient handling, and disease treatment. Exotic pets can be broadly classified into two categories: predatory species and prey species. Rabbits are very gentle but as an exotic prey species, the rabbit may react abruptly to threatening situations with little warning. Rabbits are also susceptible to heat exhaustion. Urolithiasis is not uncommon in rabbits and is frequently caused by calcium carbonate and triple phosphate crystals. The most common neoplastic disease seen in adult female rabbits is uterine adenocarcinoma. A common cause of neurological disease in the pet rabbit is Encephalitozoon cuniculi. The guinea pig is a friendly prey species that is very good at running away from predators. Guinea pigs may present with gastrointestinal stasis or enterotoxemia. Urolithiasis is common in guinea pigs. Chinchillas are another prey species that rarely bite and are often shy and nervous. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Renal stone disease is a common and painful condition. Even though it is rarely fatal, patients describe it as the worst pain in their life. While dietary calcium may decrease the risk of stone formation, patients on supplemental calcium are at higher risk. Moreover, patients with diabetes are more prone to develop renal calculi. Hypervitaminosis D is a rare cause of hypercalcaemia. This is a case of an elderly diabetic man who developed multiple calcium oxalate renal stones due to hypercalcaemia following calcium-vitamin D supplementation. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - CASE DESCRIPTION A 5-year-old sexually intact female guinea pig was evaluated because of mild dysuria and a subcutaneous mass located cranioventral to the urogenital openings. CLINICAL FINDINGS Non–contrast-enhanced CT and surgical exploration of the distal aspect of the urethra revealed a urethral diverticulum with an intraluminal urolith. Analysis revealed that the urolith was composed of calcium carbonate and struvite. TREATMENT AND OUTCOME The urolith was surgically removed and ablation of the urethral diverticulum was attempted. Approximately 3 months later, the guinea pig was reevaluated for masses in the perineal region, and positive-contrast urethrocystog-raphy revealed 2 uroliths present in the same diverticulum. Uroliths were manually expressed with the patient under general anesthesia. Approximately 2 weeks later, urethroplasty was performed to create an enlarged stoma with the diverticulum, thereby preventing urine from pooling in the diverticulum and potentially reducing the risk of future urolith formation. The urethroplasty site healed well with no reported complications or evidence of urolith recurrence 6 months after surgery. CLINICAL RELEVANCE Urolithiasis is common in guinea pigs, and urethral diverticulum and intraluminal urolith formation should be considered as a potential differential diagnosis for a subcutaneous mass along the distal aspect of the urethra. Creation of a urethral stoma from a urethral diverticulum via urethroplasty achieved a successful outcome in this patient. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: The objective of this study was to describe the prevalence of incidental extra-cardiac findings (IECFs) on myocardial perfusion PET/CTs and the prevalence of potentially clinically relevant and clinically irrelevant IECFs, as well as detection rate of previously unknown malignancies. Methods and Results: From September 2013 until February 2016, a total of 1397 consecutive patients referred for the evaluation of possible ischemia by 13NH<inf>3</inf> PET/CT were prospectively included in a database. IECFs were categorized into three groups: potentially clinically relevant IECFs, IECFs that could potentially cause chest pain, and clinically irrelevant IECFs. Additionally, the prevalence of previously unknown malignancies was determined. In 717 (51%) of these patients, 775 IECFs were reported and 115 IECFs were categorized as potentially clinically relevant in 109 (8%) patients. A total of 145 IECFs that could potentially cause chest pain were detected in 139 (10%) patients and 515 clinically irrelevant IECFs were detected in 469 (34%) of the patients. An unknown primary malignancy was histologically proven in 19 patients (1.4%). Conclusions: IECFs are detected on myocardial perfusion PET/CT in approximately half of the patients. In the present study, IECFs were potentially clinically relevant in 8% of the patients and in 1.4% an unknown malignancy was found, most of which were lung cancers. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Four cases of obstructive urolithiasis occurred in male Visayan warty pigs (Sus cebifrons negrinus) during a 12-mo period. One animal died, two were euthanized, and one was treated successfully with a tube cystotomy procedure and a subsequent urinary acidification diet. Uroliths from two cases of urethral obstruction were analyzed and confirmed as calcium carbonate. A fifth nonobstructive case was suspected in an adult female in which calcium carbonate crystalluria was diagnosed, and that case was resolved with medical management. Possible causes of these uroliths included reduced water intake, increased calcium in the diet through use of lucerne hay, and concurrent urinary tract infections. Changes to the diet and access to water were correlated with cessation of further cases, and no recurrence has been seen to date. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first report of calcium carbonate urolithiasis and the first use of a tube cystotomy in a nondomestic pig species. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: An increasing number of case reports suggest that acquired renal Fanconi syndrome may be associated with prolonged use of adefovir against hepatitis B virus. Renal Fanconi syndrome is an uncommon disease, and its complication with nephrolithiasis is quite rare. Herein, we report a rare coexistence of nephrolithiasis and acquired renal Fanconi syndrome in a chronic hepatitis B-positive patient with prolonged adefovir therapy. Case presentation: The patient presented with osteomalacia and nephrolithiasis. Consequently, extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy and left double-J ureteral stent insertion were considered for obstructive nephropathy, which was caused by nephrolithiasis. However, osteomalacia had been misdiagnosed as osteoporosis before admission to our hospital. On admission, a complexity of multiple fractures, hypophosphataemia, glycosuria without hyperglycaemia and non-anion-gap metabolic acidosis indicated a diagnosis of acquired renal Fanconi syndrome induced by adefovir. After switching from adefovir to entecavir, the patient's symptoms and laboratory findings improved significantly. Conclusions: The mechanism responsible for nephrolithiasis in renal Fanconi syndrome is still unclear. We recommend regularly monitoring renal function and serum calcium and serum phosphate to prevent renal Fanconi syndrome during the prolonged use of adefovir for hepatitis B virus. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Purpose To investigate frequencies, levels, clinical relevance and predictors of potential drug-drug interactions (pDDIs) in pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). Methods Case notes of 411 patients were reviewed for pDDIs through Micromedex. Frequencies, levels and clinical relevance of pDDIs were reported. Logistic regression was applied to calculate the odds-ratios for predictors of pDDIs. Results We recorded pDDIs in 59.4% patients. Major-pDDIs were found in 34.5% patients. Total 990 pDDIs were identified, of which, 37.8% were of moderate-severity and 30.6% of major-severity. Patient's case notes of top-ten pDDIs showed presence of signs/symptoms such as fever, jaundice, vomiting, anorexia, tachycardia, drowsiness, & lethargy; and abnormalities in labs such as total leukocytes count, blood urea nitrogen, alanine aminotransferase, & potassium-level. Odds of exposure to major-pDDIs were significantly higher in patients aged 6–12 years (p = 0.008); hospital stay of ≥ 7 days (p = 0.05); and ≥ 11 prescribed medicines (p < 0.001). Conclusion Substantial numbers of patients in PICU are exposed to pDDIs. Major-pDDIs are of particular concern. Timely identification of pDDIs, preferably with computerized source, is crucial point for their management. Monitoring of clinically relevant parameters and identification of various predictors are needed to minimize or prevent the associated negative consequences of pDDIs. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Many urine proteins are found in calcium oxalate stones, yet decades of research have failed to define the role of urine proteins in stone formation. This urine proteomic study compares the relative amounts of abundant urine proteins between idiopathic calcium oxalate stone forming and non-stone forming (normal) cohorts to identify differences that might correlate with disease. Random mid-morning urine samples were collected following informed consent from 25 stone formers and 14 normal individuals. Proteins were isolated from urine using ultrafiltration. Urine proteomes for each sample were characterized using label-free spectral counting mass spectrometry, so that urine protein relative abundances could be compared between the two populations. A total of 407 unique proteins were identified with the 38 predominant proteins accounting for >82% of all sample spectral counts. The most highly abundant proteins were equivalent in stone formers and normals, though significant differences were observed in a few moderate abundance proteins (immunoglobulins, transferrin, and epidermal growth factor), accounting for 13 and 10% of the spectral counts, respectively. These proteins contributed to a cationic shift in protein distribution in stone formers compared to normals (22% vs. 18%, p = 0.04). Our data showing only small differences in moderate abundance proteins suggest that no single protein controls stone formation. Observed increases in immunoglobulins and transferrin suggest increased inflammatory activity in stone formers, but cannot distinguish cause from effect in stone formation. The observed cationic shift in protein distribution would diminish protein charge stabilization, which could lead to protein aggregation and increased risk for crystal aggregation. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Knowledge of the mineral composition of the causative urolith is important to develop preventative strategies. Advances in analytic techniques have led to detection of urolith components not previously recognized. Hypothesis/Objectives: The objectives of this study were to characterize uroliths in sheep and goats structurally and clinically. We hypothesized that amorphous magnesium calcium phosphate (AMCP) would be a naturally occurring urolith type in sheep and goats. Animals: Forty-nine sheep and goats presenting for obstructive urolithiasis from June 15, 2014 through June 14, 2016 were reviewed along with the demographic data of all small ruminants admitted during that same period. Methods: Medical records were reviewed for demographic and historical data, and 36 uroliths obtained from these cases during diagnostic or therapeutic procedures were analyzed by infrared spectroscopy to determine chemical composition. Results: AMCP is a naturally occurring urolith type in obstructed male sheep and goats and was the most common urolith type in this study, where it occurred as a majority component with struvite (39% of uroliths) or as a pure component (11%). Pure struvite was found in 1 urolith (2%). Calcium carbonate was the second most frequent urolith with 31% of uroliths being pure calcium carbonate. Conclusions and Clinical Importance: This study demonstrates that uroliths, which appear consistent with struvite, could actually be calcium-containing AMCP. Urolith analysis is critical in determining mineral content of uroliths to guide dietary recommendations for prevention. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Spinach (Spinacia oleracea L.) is often used as a base vegetable to make green juices that are promoted as healthy dietary alternatives. Spinach is known to contain significant amounts of oxalates, which are toxic and, if consumed regularly, can lead to the development of kidney stones. This research investigates adding 50–500 mg increments of calcium carbonate, calcium chloride, calcium citrate and calcium sulphate to 100 g of raw homogenates of spinach to determine whether calcium would combine with the soluble oxalate present in the spinach. Calcium chloride was the most effective additive while calcium carbonate was the least effective. The formation of insoluble oxalate after incubation at 25 °C for 30 min is a simple practical step that can be incorporated into the juicing process. This would make the juice considerably safer to consume on a regular basis. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The study was conducted on 13 male bovine animals suffering from obstructive urolithiasis to evaluate the diagnostic approach, surgical outcome and mineral composition of uroliths. The animals were divided in two groups, Group I (n=8) of young animals and Group II (n=5) of adult animals. B-mode ultrasonography was done for locating the uroliths in penile urethra. All the animals were subjected to urethrotomy followed by ultrasonography at the suspected site of urolith lodgement. Ammonium chloride as urinary acidifier was given @ 50 mg/kg body weight orally for 60 days was found beneficial for preventing recurrence of uroliths. It was observed that urethra heals normally in three weeks if left unsutured and the majority of uroliths were present at tip of penis in Group I and in sigmoid flexure in Group II animals. Staphylococcus species were the most prevalent bacteria causing bovine urinary tract infections associated with urolithiasis in both groups. It was concluded that ultrasonography was efficient to localize uroliths in urethra in both groups of animals. On Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy estimation, calcium carbonate, carbonate apatite in Group I whereas calcium carbonate in majority of Group II animals, were the most common types of minerals causing formation of uroliths. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Nephrolithiasis is a frequent condition. While it is generally accepted that such condition carries a risk of recurrence over time, the exact risk and its predictors have been rarely quantitated. We aimed to estimate recurrence of kidney stones, overall and in specific subgroups, from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of calcium stone formers. Methods: Systematic review of RCTs of adult patients with idiopathic calcium kidney stones. Recurrence rates analyzed in subgroups based on type of intervention and other characteristics, using Poisson regression models. Results: The analysis included 21 RCTs with 2168 participants over a median follow-up of 3.2 years (range 0.5–9.7). The median recurrence of kidney stones was 15 per 100 person–years (range 0–110). Recurrence was higher in those with two or more previous stone episodes compared to those with a single episode at enrolment (16 vs. 6 per 100 person–years, p < 0.001) and in those untreated or treated with dietary changes compared to those treated with drugs (26 vs. 23 vs. 9 per 100 person–years, p < 0.001). The effect of drugs on recurrence seemed to be beneficial only among those with two or more previous stone episodes. Conclusions: The overall recurrence rate of stones depends on factors such as previous stone history and type of treatment. Dietary approaches seem to be more effective among single stone formers, whereas drugs seem to be more effective among recurrent stone formers. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Regulated dicarboxylate transport is critical for acid-base homeostasis, prevention of calcium nephrolithiasis, regulation of collecting duct sodium chloride transport, and the regulation of blood pressure. Although luminal dicarboxylate reabsorption via NaDC1 (SLC13A2) is believed to be the primary mechanism regulating renal dicarboxylate transport, the specific localization of NaDC1 in the human kidney is currently unknown. This study’s purpose was to determine NaDC1’s expression in normal and neoplastic human kidneys. Immunoblot analysis demonstrated NaDC1 expression with an apparent molecular weight of ~61 kDa. Immunohis-tochemistry showed apical NaDC1 immunolabel in the proximal tubule of normal human kidney tissue; well-preserved proximal tubule brush border was clearly labeled. Apical NaDC1 expression was evident throughout the entire proximal tubule, including the initial proximal convoluted tubule, as identified by origination from the glomerular tuft, and extending through the terminal of the proximal tubule, the proximal straight tubule in the outer medulla. We confirmed proximal tubule localization by colocalization with the proximal tubule specific protein, NBCe1. NaDC1 immunolabel was not detected other than in the proximal tubule. In addition, NaDC1 immunolabel was not detected in tumors of presumed proximal tubule origin, clear cell and papillary renal cell carcinoma, or in tumors of nonproximal tubule origin, oncocytoma and chromophobe carcinoma. In summary, 1) in the human kidney, apical NaDC1 immunolabel is present throughout the entire proximal tubule, and is not detectable in other renal cells; and 2) NaDC1 immunolabel is not present in renal tumors. These studies provide important information regarding NaDC1’s role in human dicarboxylate metabolism. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Purpose of Review: The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of calcium supplements, with or without vitamin D, in urinary stone formation in healthy population and in osteoporotic patients as well. Moreover, this review aims to clarify whether or not, and above which dose, they are associated with the risk of lithiasis. Recent Findings: A research in Medline, Embase, and Scopus databases up to September 2015 was conducted using the following keywords: calcium, supplements, vitamin D, complications, lithiasis, and urinary stone. All types of studies were taken into account (cohort studies, reviews, meta-analyses), and in case they fulfilled the inclusion criteria, they were included in our review. The analysis of the data showed that calcium supplements, probably in association with anti osteoporotic treatment, do not create a predisposition towards lithiasis formation among women suffering from osteoporosis, neither among non-osteoporotic older men. In healthy postmenopausal as well as younger women, the supplements might increase susceptibility to urinary stone formation in long-term basis. The consumption of calcium supplements with the meals could play a protective role in women and younger males. There is certain evidence that supplements containing citrate may be more beneficial over the rest of calcium supplements, particularly when consumed during the meal. Summary: Osteoporotic women and healthy men are not at risk of stone formation. On the contrary, healthy women should be aware of the potential risk of developing urinary lithiasis in long-term basis. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Context The incidence of urinary tract stone disease is increasing and the risk of recurrent stone formation is high. Appropriate therapeutic procedures with the aim of counteracting the progress of stone formation are highly desirable. Metabolic work-up is considered essential as a base for optimal design and follow-up of effective recurrence prevention. Objective To scrutinize the current literature with regard to principles of metabolic work-up for this heterogeneous group of patients. Evidence acquisition Relevant articles in PubMed, guideline documents, consensus reports, and the Cochrane Library published during the past 20 yr were consulted. Evidence synthesis Grades of recommendation were used according to the principles applied in the European Association of Urology and American Urological Association guidelines. Medical efforts to prevent recurrent stone formation should be part of the care of patients with urinary tract stone disease (grade of recommendation A). A careful medical history and imaging together with analysis of stone composition, blood, and urine provide the basis for appropriate measures, but the treatment has to be individualized (grade of recommendation D). Whenever possible, stone analysis should be carried out at least once for every patient or each time when a long time has elapsed between two stone episodes because the risk factors explaining stone formation may have changed (clinical principle). The medical history, including information on dietary and drinking habits as well as lifestyle, is necessary for appropriate advice (grade of recommendation C). The medical history, together with imaging and stone composition, is used to estimate the severity of the disease (clinical principle). Identification of specific medical conditions should be supported by blood and/or urine analysis (grade of recommendation B). Pharmacological agents associated with an increased risk of stone formation should be identified (grade of recommendation C). Patients who have formed noncalcium stones should always be given recurrence preventive treatment. Analysis of urine composition for these patients is optional, but might be of value in the follow-up to support decisions on appropriate dosage regimens (grade of recommendation C). For patients with idiopathic calcium stone disease information from 24-h urine samples should be used, although the number of samples to be taken is debated (grade of recommendation C). Information from 24-h urine analysis should be used for selective dietary and drinking advice as well as for selection of the most appropriate pharmacological agent (grade of recommendation B). The treatment effects on the risk of stone formation can be followed by estimates of supersaturation based on urine composition (grade of recommendation C). Conclusions It is clear that the metabolic work-up of patients with urinary tract stone disease should be individualized according to stone type and severity of the disease, and that the different therapeutic approaches are closely associated with the availability of therapeutic tools and motivation by the patient. Patient summary Effective prevention of recurrent stone formation is determined by several factors such as the current and previous stone episodes and surgical procedures, stone composition, medical history, dietary and drinking habits, lifestyle, and ongoing pharmacological therapy. Analysis of blood and urine is an important part of the metabolic evaluation, but how extensive the risk evaluation should be is determined by the type of stone and the severity of the disease. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Percutaneous stone manipulation by direct ultrasound disintegration, extraction or chemolysis was done on 34 patients. A total of 15 patients presented with an operatively established nephrostomy, while percutaneous nephrostomy and subsequent dilation of the nephrostomy channel were done in 19. The rate of complete stone clearance was 19 of 20 stones after percutaneous nephrostomy and 8 of 16 stones in the group with an operatively established nephrostomy. The primary goal, to remove obstructing pelvic stones, was achieved in all cases. There were no untoward side effects, such as back pressure damage owing to flushing of the collecting system during ultrasound disintegration, or persistent infection. Complications in 3 patients were managed conservatively. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Objective To investigate the incidence of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) following percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) and evaluate any association with unplanned 90-day readmission. Methods We retrospectively reviewed consecutive patients undergoing PCNL in 2 dedicated endourologic practices between 2009 and 2013. We collected patient demographics, perioperative culture data, and operative characteristics. SIRS was defined as having 2 or more of the following: maximum white blood cell count >12,000 or <4000, temperature >38 or <34°C, heart rate >90, and respiratory rate >20 within the first 24 hours following PCNL. Proportions between groups were compared to identify significant associations. Results We identified 389 patients undergoing PCNL and 43% (167 of 389) met SIRS criteria, more commonly in patients with multiple PCNL accesses (OR 2.3; CI: 1.1-4.8, P = .025). Readmission was required in 8% (31 of 389), most commonly for infection (n = 21). Although possession of a struvite stone was associated with unplanned readmission (16% vs 4%, P < .01), SIRS in the absence of fever within 48 hours postoperative was not associated with readmission (29.4% vs 25.8%, P = .837). Conclusion Nearly half of the patients undergoing PCNL met the criteria for SIRS within the first postoperative day. There was no association between SIRS and unplanned readmission in the postoperative PCNL patient. Despite discharge during the first postoperative day, patients with SIRS (without fever or struvite stones) had no increased risk for unplanned return. Our findings suggest that the development of SIRS immediately following PCNL does not preclude safe discharge on the first postoperative day. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - A critical examination of data in the literature and in as yet unpublished laboratory records on the possible role of so-called inhibitors of crystallisation in preventing the formation of calcium-containing kidney stones leads to the following conclusions. So-called inhibitors of spontaneous “self-nucleation” are unlikely to play any role in the initiation of the crystallisation of CaOx or CaP in urine because excessive urinary supersaturation of urine with respect to these salts dominates the onset of “self-nucleation” within the normal time frame of the transit of tubular fluid through the nephron (3–4 min). Inhibitors of the crystal growth of CaOx crystals may or may not play a significant role in the prevention of CaOx stone-formation since once again excessive supersaturation of urine can overwhelm any potential effect of the inhibitors on the growth process. However, they may play a role as inhibitors of crystal growth at lower levels of metastable supersaturation when the balance between supersaturation and inhibitors is more equal. Inhibitors of CaOx crystal aggregation may play a significant role in the prevention of stones, since they do not appear to be strongly affected by excessive supersaturation, either in vitro or in vivo. Inhibitors of CaOx crystal binding to renal tubular epithelium may exist but further studies are necessary to elucidate their importance in reducing the risk of initiating stones in the renal tubules. Inhibitors of CaOx crystal binding to Randall’s Plaques and Randall’s Plugs may exist but further studies are necessary to elucidate their importance in reducing the risk of initiating stones on renal papillae. There may be an alternative explanation other than a deficiency in the excretion of inhibitors for the observations that there is a difference between CaOx crystal size and degree of aggregation in the fresh, warm urines of normal subjects compared those in urine from patients with recurrent CaOx stones. This difference may depend more on the site of “self-nucleation” of CaOx crystals in the renal tubule rather than on a deficiency in the excretion of so-called inhibitors of crystallisation by patients with CaOx stones. The claim that administration of potassium citrate, potassium magnesium citrate or magnesium hydroxide reduces the rate of stone recurrence may be due to the effect of these forms of medication on the supersaturation of urine with respect to CaOx and CaP rather than to any increase in “inhibitory activity” attributed to these forms of treatment. In summary, there is a competition between supersaturation and so-called inhibitors of crystallisation which ultimately determines the pattern of crystalluria in stone-formers and normals. If the supersaturation of urine with respect to CaOx reaches or exceeds the 3–4 min formation product of that salt, then it dominates the crystallisation process both in terms of “self-nucleation” and crystal growth but appears to have little or no effect on the degree of aggregation of the crystals produced. At supersaturation levels of urine with respect to CaOx well below the 3–4 min formation product of that salt, the influence of inhibitors increases and some may affect not only the degree of aggregation but also the crystal growth of any pre-formed crystals of CaOx at these lower levels of metastability. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Urinary silicate calculi in humans are extremely rare. Reported cases of silicate calculi are mostly documented in adults and are commonly related to an excessive intake of magnesium trisilicate in food or drugs. Published studies on the presence of silicate calculi in children are scarce. Cases: Three cases of silicate kidney stones without prior silicate intake are reported. Two patients underwent surgical treatment, and the third patient was treated using conservative methods. Urinalysis revealed no underlying metabolic abnormalities. Analyses revealed that silicate was the major component of the stones. Conclusion: Siliceous deposits in urinary stones may be more common than anticipated, and the underlying pathophysiology remains to be clarified. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: The presence of macroscopic concretions in the urinary system is called urolithiasis. In horses the occurrence is rare. The calculi are generally large and unique spicule concretions, composed of calcium carbonate crystals. Less commonly, the concretions are of mixed crystals of calcium carbonate and of calcium phosphate. The aim of the this work was to report a case of obstructive urethrolithiasis in a horse. Case: A 1-year-and-5-month-old, undefined breed, uncastrated male presented tenesmus, strangury, and dysuria. The horse died seven days after the onset of clinical signs and was referred for necropsy. At necropsy, samples were collected from organs of the abdominal cavity, thoracic cavity, central nervous system and integumentary system. The fragments were fixed in 10% formaldehyde, cleaved, routinely processed for histology and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. A urinary calculus collected during necropsy was sent for chemical analysis. In the abdominal cavity, a large quantity of citrus liquid of uremic odor was observed. Deposition of fibrin filaments in the peritoneum was observed, as well as in diaphragm and abdominal organs. Serosa of the small and large intestine was red with evidence of the capillaries. Kidneys presented multiple slightly protrusive white areas with a maximum diameter of 3 mm. When cutting, these areas were limited to the cortical region. There was rupture of the urinary bladder, diffuse loss of the mucosa with capillary exposure and evidence, as well as the deposition of fibrin and crude blood clots. The opening of the penile urethra presented a urolith of approximately 3.5 x 3 cm in size, with a rough and porous surface, light brown and of a stony consistency. Necrosis of the mucosa and hemorrhage were also observed in the urethra. Microscopically, the kidney showed multiple foci formed by intense inflammatory infiltrate composed of macrophages, neutrophils and plasma cells in the interstitium of the cortical region. In the urinary bladder, there was diffuse necrosis of the lining epithelium, marked inflammatory infiltrate composed mainly of neutrophils in the submucosa, in addition to fibrin deposition and edema. Penile urethra presented changes similar to those described in the urinary bladder. The chemical analysis of the urinary calculus demonstrated the presence of calcium oxalate, triple magnesium ammonia (struvite) phosphate and ammonium in its composition. Discussion: The diagnosis of obstructive urethrolithiasis was established from the clinical-pathological condition. The occurrence of urolithiasis in horses is rare. The lower occurrence in this species is probably attributed to the large amount of mucus produced by the glands in the renal pelvis and the proximal ureter, which acts as a lubricant to prevent the adhesion of the crystals to the urothelium. The absence of sigmoid flexure and vermiform urethral process in equine also influence the low occurrence of the disease, when compared to ruminants. Rupture of the urinary bladder followed by uroperitonitis and nephritis as observed in this case are common consequences in obstructive urolithiasis. Uroliths in equines are generally composed of a variety of hydrated calcium salts and calcium carbonate, magnesium, and phosphorus salts, with less common struvite compounds. Urethrolithiasis is poorly described in horses and can be caused by struvite stones. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Hypoparathyroidism (HPT) is a rare disease with leading symptoms of hypocalcemia, associated with high serum phosphorus levels and absent or inappropriately low levels of parathyroid hormone (PTH). In patients with thalassemias it is mainly attributed to transfusional iron overload, and suboptimal iron chelation therapy. The main objectives of this survey were to provide data on the prevalence, demographic and clinical features of HPT in thalassemia major (TM) and intermedia (TI) patients living in different countries, and to assess its impact in clinical medical practice. A questionnaire was sent to all Thalassemia Centres participating to the International Network of Clinicians for Endocrinopathies in Thalassemia and Adolescence 436 V. De Sanctis, A.T. Soliman, D. Canatan, et al.Medicine (ICET-A) Network.Seventeen centers, treating a total of 3023 TM and 739 TI patients, participated to the study. HPT was reported in 206 (6.8%) TM patients and 33 (4.4%) TI patients. In general, ages ranged from 10.5 to 57 years for the TM group and from 20 to 54 years for the TI group. Of the 206 TM patients and 33 TI patients with HPT, 117 (48.9%) had a serum ferritin level >2.500 ng/ml (54.3% TM and 15.1% TI patients) at the last observation. Hypocalcemia varied in its clinical presentation from an asymptomatic biochemical abnormality to a life-threatening condition, requiring hospitalization. Calcium and vitamin D metabolites are currently the cornerstone of therapy in HPT. In TM patients, HPT was preceded or followed by other endocrine and non-endocrine complications. Growth retardation and hypogonadism were the most common complications (53.3% and 67.4%, respectively). Although endocrine complications were more common in patients with TM, non-transfused or infrequently transfused patients with TI suffered a similar spectrum of complications but at a lower rate than their regularly transfused counterparts. In conclusion, although a large international registry would help to better define the prevalence, comorbidities and best treatment of HPT, through the result of this survey we hope to give a clearer understanding of the burden of this disease and its unmet needs. HPT requires lifelong therapy with vitamin D or metabolites and is often associated with complications and comorbidities.Therefore, it is important for endocrinologists and other physicians, who care for these patients, to be aware of recent advances of this disorder. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - In this study, it was aimed to present the results of diagnosis and treatment of urinary tract urolithiasis in 10 cats brought to our clinic. Ten cats with urinary tract complaint used for the study. Urolithiasis diagnosis was made through urine analysis, direct and indirect radiography and ultrasonographic findings. Eight cases were applied operative procedure and two cases were administered medical treatment. Accomplishment was gained with chalcolithic diet and infection control along with operative procedure in two of four cats with struvite urolith. Urethrotomy, cystotomy and urohydropropulsion were performed to remove calcium oxalate, calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate and ammonium urate urolith. Pets were postoperatively controlled on the 30th day in order to check whether uroliths were reappeared. In this study, it was found that frequency of uroliths in descending order may be sorted as struvite, calcium oxalate, ammonium urate, calcium carbonate and calcium phosphate. Consequently for the diagnosis of urolithiasis, it is required to evaluate urine pH, crystalluria, hematuria, urine leukocyte values and stone analysis along with the results obtained from direct positive contrast radiography and ultrasonography. Operative approach is indicated for urolith cases and post-operative special diets and medical treatment according to urolith type prevent relapse. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Hypoparathyroidism is a rare endocrine disorder in which parathyroid hormone (PTH) production is abnormally low or absent, resulting in low serum calcium and increased serum phosphorus. The most common cause of hypoparathyroidism is parathyroid gland injury or inadvertent removal during thyroid surgery. Current treatments include supplementation with calcium and active vitamin D, with goal albumin-corrected serum calcium level in the low-normal range of 8-9 mg/dl. Complications of the disease include renal dysfunction, nephrocalcinosis, kidney stones, extracellular calcifications of the basal ganglia, and posterior subcapsular cataracts, as well as low bone turnover and increased bone density. Until January 2015, hypoparathyroidism was the only classic endocrine disease without an available hormone replacement. Recombinant human PTH 1-84, full-length PTH, is now available for a selected group of patients with the disease who are not well controlled on the current standard therapy of calcium and active vitamin D. In addition, the role of PTH replacement on quality of life, intracerebral calcifications, cataracts, improving bone turnover, and reduction of renal complications of the disease remains to be further investigated. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Cystinuria is an inherited disorder characterized by defective renal reabsorption of cystine and dibasic amino acids leading to nephrolithiasis. This study was conducted to analyze the genotypes and phenotypes of pediatric patients with cystinuria. Eight children from Seoul National University Hospital and Asan Medical Center presenting with cystinuria from January 2003 to June 2016 were retrospectively analyzed. Mutational studies were performed by direct sequencing. Two of the 8 were male and 6 were female. The median ages at onset and diagnosis were 1.5 (range, 0.3-13.6) and 2.6 (range, 0.7-16.7) years, respectively. The median followed up was 7.7 (range, 3.4-14.0) years. Mutational analyses were performed in 7 patients and revealed biallelic SLC3A1 mutations (AA genotype) in 4 patients, a single heterozygous SLC3A1 mutation (A- genotype) in 1 patient, biallelic SLC7A9 mutations (BB genotype) in 1 patient, and a single heterozygous SLC7A9 mutation (B- genotype) in 1 patient. Two of the mutations were novel. No genotype-phenotype correlations were observed, except for earlier onset age in patients with non-AA genotypes than in patients with the AA genotype. All patients suffered from recurrent attacks of symptomatic nephrolithiasis, which lead to urologic interventions. At the last follow-up, 3 patients had a mild-to-moderate degree of renal dysfunction. This is the first study of genotypic and phenotypic analyses of patients with cystinuria in Korea. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Chemical antiscalants are usually used to control scale depositions, a major concern in industry. Some of these products may be harmful towards environment or toxic for humans, so environmentally friendly antiscalant are needed. In this respect, plant extracts can be used as new green antiscalant agents. In this work, stock aqueous solution of Herniaria glabra (H. glabra) was obtained by infusion. H. glabra is used in traditional medicine to treat or prevent urolithiasis; it could be an interesting candidate as a green antiscaling agent. The properties of H. glabra towards CaCO<inf>3</inf>formation were tested by using chronoamperometry and Fast Controlled Precipitation methods. An n-butanol solution was used to partition the aqueous solution of H. glabra, yielding a polar compounds-free fraction. This fraction was also studied by chronoamperometry and Fast Controlled Precipitation methods. The results showed a better inhibition efficiency towards CaCO<inf>3</inf>precipitation for the n-butanol fraction compared to the crude H. glabra solution. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - This investigation reports the mineralogy and possible pathological significance of urinary stones removed from patients in Fars province, Iran. X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and polarizing microscope (PM) techniques were used to investigate the mineralogical compositions of urinary stones. The identified mineral components include whewellite, weddellite, hydroxyapatite, uricite and cystine. These techniques revealed that the whewellite and uricite were the most common mineral phases. Platy-like/monoclinic whewellite, prismatic/monoclinic uric acid and hexagonal cystine crystals were revealed by SEM. Biominerals (calcium carbonate) and quartz were also identified in PM images. Of the variables determining the type of precipitated minerals, the effects of pH on depositional conditions proved to be the most apparent parameter, as shown by occurrences and relationships among the studied minerals. Our results revealed the importance of detailed knowledge of mineralogical composition in assessing the effects of age and sex. The highest incidence of urinary stones was observed in the 40-60 age group. Calcium oxalate and uric acid stones are more frequent in men than women. Finally, the study concluded that knowledge of the mineralogical composition of urinary stones is important as it helps the scientific community to explain the chemistry and the etiology of the calculi in the urinary system. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Topiramate is an antiepileptic drug indicated for the treatment of seizure disorders, migraine prophylaxis, and, more recently, weight loss. This new indication will likely increase the use of this agent significantly. As a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, topiramate can affect the pH of bodily fluids and is known to increase the risk of nephrolithiasis. However, as discussed in the present report, these properties also result in an as yet unaddressed risk of the development of sialoliths, calcified stones formed in the salivary duct or glands. The physiologic mechanisms for stone development in the salivary gland are reviewed and the pharmacologic effects of topiramate on sialolith formation discussed. The present report describes a female patient treated with topiramate for migraine prophylaxis who subsequently presented with a sialolith in the left submandibular duct. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Objective This study aims to evaluate the effect of bladder diverticula (BD) on bladder function using a rabbit model, based on urodynamic findings. Methods A total of 32 New Zealand white rabbits were randomly assigned to four groups: (1) sham surgery; (2) a single, 1-cm-diameter BD; (3) a single, large, 3-cm-diameter BD; and (4) four (multi) 1-cm-diameter BD. Urodynamic evaluations were performed preoperatively, and 1 week and 1 month postoperatively, to measure the postmicturition residual (PMR), maximum bladder capacity (MBC), filling and voiding detrusor pressure (Pdet), compliance, and unstable detrusor contractions. At the end of the study, the animals were sacrificed and assessed for pathologic evaluation and stone formation. Results In groups 3 and 4, the rabbits all had PMR. At 30 days postsurgery, the MBC was found to be 28% and 31% lower than the reference range in groups 3 and 4 and compliance was decreased (p < 0.05). Further, the filling Pdet was significantly higher for large and multiple BD than in the 1-cm diverticula or sham groups (6.33 ± 1.73, 4 ± 1.26, p = 0.0001). Groups 3 (62%) and 4 (50%) had unstable detrusor contractions. There was also a muscular/collagen ratio increase in the large and multiple BD groups. Four rabbits in the large group and one rabbit in the multiple BD group exhibited stone formation. Conclusions Large or multiple BD can alter bladder storage and emptying, and can decrease the capacity of the bladder and reduce its elasticity. Large or multiple bladder diverticula can lead to involuntary contractions, causing dysfunctional voiding. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Dent disease classically combines low-molecular-weight proteinuria, hypercalciuria with nephrocalcinosis, and renal failure. Nephrotic range proteinuria, normal calciuria, and hypokalemia have been rarely reported. It is unknown whether the changes in phenotype observed over time are explained by a decrease in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) or whether there is any phenotype-genotype relationship. To answer this we retrospectively analyzed data from 109 male patients with CLCN5 mutations (Dent-1) and 9 patients with mutation of the OCRL gene (Dent-2). In Dent-1 disease, the estimated GFR decreased with age, by 1.0 to 1.6 ml/min per 1.73 m2/yr in the absence and presence of nephrocalcinosis, respectively, with no significant difference. Median values of low-molecular-weight proteinuria were in the nephrotic range and remained at the same level even in late renal disease. End-stage renal disease occurred in 12 patients, at a median age of 40 years. Hypercalciuria decreased with glomerular filtration and was absent in 40% of the patients under 30 and 85% of those over the age of 30. Hypophosphatemia did not resolve with age and calcitriol concentrations were in the upper normal range. Kalemia decreased with age, with half of the patients over the age of 18 presenting with hypokalemia. Thus, no phenotype/genotype correlation was observed in this cohort of patients with Dent disease. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Background and Purpose: Struvite stones have been associated with significant morbidity and mortality, yet there has not been a report on the medical management of struvite stones in almost 20 years. We report on the contemporary outcomes of the surgical and medical management of struvite stones in a contemporary series. Patients and Methods: A retrospective review of patients who were treated with percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) for struvite stones at Duke University Medical Center between January 2005 and September 2012 identified a total of 75 patients. Of these, 43 patients had adequate follow-up and were included in this analysis. Stone activity, defined as either stone recurrence or stone-related events, and predictors of activity were evaluated after combined surgical and medical treatment. Results: The study included 43 patients with either pure (35%) or mixed (65%) struvite stones with a median age of 55±15 years (range 21-89 years). The stone-free rate after PCNL was 42%. Stone recurrence occurred in 23% of patients. Postoperatively, 30% of patients had a stone-related event, while 60% of residual stones remained stable with no growth after a median follow-up of 22 months (range 6-67 mos). Kidney function remained stable during follow-up. Independent predictors of stone activity included the presence of residual stones >0.4 cm2, preoperative large stone burden (>10 cm2), and the presence of medical comorbidities (P<0.05). Conclusions: Struvite stones can be managed safely with PCNL followed by medical therapy. The majority of patients with residual fragments demonstrated no evidence of stone growth on medical therapy. With careful follow-up and medical management, kidney function can be maintained and stone morbidity can be minimized. Initial large stone burden, residual stones after surgery, and associated medical comorbidities may have deleterious effect on stone recurrence or residual stone-related events. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Context: Human recombinant (rh)PTH(1-84) was recently approved for the treatment of refractory hypoparathyroidism, based upon a short-term phase 3 clinical trial. Long-term data are needed, because no time limit was placed on the treatment period. Objective: We studied the effect of long-term rhPTH(1-84) treatment in hypoparathyroidism for up to 6 years. Design: Prospective open-label study. Setting: Referral center. Patients: A total of 33 subjects with hypoparathyroidism. Interventions: rhPTH(1-84) treatment was initiated at a starting dose of 100 μg every other day for 6 years. Due to the availability of new dosages during the 6-year time period of the study, the dose could be and was adjusted for most patients to a daily dosing regimen. Main Outcome Measures: Supplemental calcium and vitamin D requirements, serum and urinary calcium (monthly for 6 mo and then biannually), serum phosphorus, bone turnover markers, and bone mineral density (BMD) biannually. Results: Treatment with rhPTH(1-84) progressively reduced supplemental calcium requirements over 6 years by 53% (P μ.0001) and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D requirements by 67% (P μ.0001). Sixteen subjects (48%) were able to eliminate 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D supplementation completely. Serum calcium concentration remained stable, and urinary calcium excretion fell. Lumbar spine BMD increased (3.8-1%, P <.004) as did total hip BMD (2.4-1%, P <.02), whereas femoral neck BMD remained stable and the distal one third radius decreased (-4.4-1%, P μ.0001). Bone turnover markers increased significantly, reaching a 3-fold peak above baseline values at 1 year and subsequently declining but remaining higher than pretreatment values. Hypercalcemia was uncommon (12 episodes over 6 y; 2.5% of all values). Conclusions: Long-term, continuous therapy of hypoparathyroidism for 6 years with rhPTH(1-84) is associated with reductions in supplemental calcium and calcitriol requirements, stable serum calcium concentration, and reduced urinary calcium excretion. The safety profile remains good.

AB  - Background: Hyperparathyroidism is a disease characterized by excessive secretion of parathyroid hormone, the hormone responsible for calcium and phosphate homeostasis in the body. It can be of three types: primary, secondary, or tertiary. It is essential to bear in mind that in any one patient more than one type of hyperparathyroidism may be found, which may create perplexity regarding the etiology of the case. Hyperparathyroidism can become apparent early in its course when a patient presents with symptoms of abdominal pain, recurrent renal calculi, repeated fractures, or behavior changes. It is generally accepted that bone involvement is a late manifestation of primary hyperparathyroidism. It is imperative to consider that some patients, such as our patient described in this report, may be previously asymptomatic clinically and on the basis of laboratory findings and present with only late skeletal manifestations. Brown tumors are one of the mimickers of lytic lesions of the jaw and need to be ruled out early in the course of management. Researchers in several studies published in high-impact journals have recommended the use of high-dose vitamin D as safe in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism without the risk of raising calcium levels significantly. In our patient, we observed considerable hypercalcemia after high-dose vitamin D therapy, and we propose exercising discretion with the use of high-dose therapies. Case presentation: We report a case of a 21-year-old Arab woman with a brown tumor who presented with hypocalcaemia. She presented with a mixed picture of primary hyperparathyroidism and severe vitamin D deficiency. Conclusions: Brown tumors, although thought to be a forgotten entity with the advent of early screening for hypercalcemia, is still prevalent, as a handful of patients may present late in the disease course with no early markers, such as in our patient. We emphasize using a holistic approach for early diagnosis and adopting a restricted attitude to treating these benign entities, especially in the context of cosmesis for sensitive locations such as the face. In addition, we express caution in using daily supplementation with a high vitamin D dose to improve vitamin D status and decrease parathyroid hormone. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Urolithiasis is an important disease of food animals and a few cases are reported in camels. Camel is an animal which anatomically and physiologically adapted itself to weather condition of desert and it can produce urine twice more than viscosity of sea water. This investigation was undertaken to study prevalence of urolithiasis and determination of calculi composition in camel in Najaf-Abad slaughter house, Iran. Therefore, total, 600 urinary bladders of camel were studied. This survey showed 4 urinary stones in four 5-7 years old male camels. The first stone was cream, 0.5-0.7 millimeter diameter, 0.35 gram weight, rough and uneven with Calcium carbonate, ammonium carbonate and Calcium phosphate. The second stone was cream, 0.8-0.9 millimeter, 0.65 gram, smooth with Calcium carbonate, Calcium hydrogen phosphate, Magnesium ammonium phosphate plus other ingredients. The third stone was cream, 0.2-0.3 millimeter, 0.15 gram with rough and uneven surface. Chemical ingredients were similar to first one. The fourth stone was cream, 0.2-0.5 millimeter, 0.25 gram with rough and uneven surface. Chemical ingredients were similar to first one. Urinary stones might be known as calcite (Calcium carbonate) and the prevalence of disease was 0.66%. There was significant correlation between sex and age group with the prevalence of urinary bladder stone. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - After stone removal, accurate analysis of urinary stone composition is the most crucial laboratory diagnostic procedure for the treatment and recurrence prevention in the stone-forming patient. The most common techniques for routine analysis of stones are infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction and chemical analysis. The aim of the present study was to assess the quality of urinary stone analysis of laboratories in Europe. Nine laboratories from eight European countries participated in six quality control surveys for urinary calculi analyses of the Reference Institute for Bioanalytics, Bonn, Germany, between 2010 and 2014.Each participant received the same blinded test samples for stone analysis. A total of 24 samples, comprising pure substances and mixtures of two or three components, were analysed. The evaluation of the quality of the laboratory in the present study was based on the attainment of 75% of the maximum total points, i.e. 99 points. The methods of stone analysis used were infrared spectroscopy (n = 7), chemical analysis (n = 1) and X-ray diffraction (n = 1). In the present study only 56% of the laboratories, four using infrared spectroscopy and one using X-ray diffraction, fulfilled the quality requirements. According to the current standard, chemical analysis is considered to be insufficient for stone analysis, whereas infrared spectroscopy or X-ray diffraction is mandatory. However, the poor results of infrared spectroscopy highlight the importance of equipment, reference spectra and qualification of the staff for an accurate analysis of stone composition. Regular quality control is essential in carrying out routine stone analysis. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - We reviewed patient records with a first-listed diagnosis of urolithiasis—also known as urinary tract or kidney stone disease, nephrolithiasis—upon discharge from Guam’s sole civilian hospital during 2006 to 2010 and urinary cancer mortality records from the Guam Cancer Registry for 1970 to 2009 to determine the source of municipal water supplied to the patients’ residence. The objective was to investigate a possible relationship between the sources of municipal water supplied to Guam villages and the incidence of urolithiasis and urinary cancer. We analyzed hospital discharge diagnoses of urolithiasis or renal calculi by calculating the incidence of first-mentioned discharge for urolithiasis or renal calculi and comparing rates across demographic or geographic categories while adjusting by age, sex, and ethnicity/race. We reviewed cancer registry records of urinary cancer deaths by patient residence. The annual incidence of hospitalization for urolithiasis was 5.22 per 10, 000. Rates adjusted for sex or age exhibited almost no change. The rate of 9.83 per 10,000 among Chamorros was significantly higher (p < 0.05) than the rates among any other ethnic group or race. When villages were grouped by water source, rates of patients discharged with a first-listed diagnosis of urolithiasis, adjusted for ethnicity/race, were similar for villages using either well water (5.44 per 10,000) or mixed source water (5.39 per 10,000), and significantly greater than the rate for villages using exclusively reservoir water (1.35 per 10,000). No statistically significant differences were found between the water source or village of residence and urinary cancer mortality. Some Guam residents living in villages served completely or partly by deep well water high in calcium carbonate may be at increased risk for urolithiasis compared with residents living in villages served by surface waters. Although the risk appears to be highest in villagers of Chamorro ethnicity, residents should be aware of other contributing risk factors and steps to take to avoid developing this health problem. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The formation of calcium carbonate in water has important implications in industry. Chemical antiscalant is usually used to control scale depositions. Plant extracts have been recently used as new green antiscalant agents, as they can be easily prepared and are environmentally friendly. In this study, stock aqueous solutions of Spergularia rubra and Parietaria officinalis, two plants used in traditional medicine to treat or prevent urolithiasis, were obtained by infusion. The antiscaling properties of these extracts towards CaCO<inf>3</inf> formation were tested by using chronoamperometry and Fast Controlled Precipitation methods.

AB  - Parathyroid carcinoma (PTCA) is a rare disease, and ectopic PTCA is particularly rare. Parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) expression in PTCA has not been previously described in the relevant literature to the best of our knowledge. The present study reports a unique case with a mediastinal parathyroid carcinoma producing parathyroid hormone (PTH) and PTHrP. A 53-year-old man presented with hyperparathyroidism symptoms, including fatigue, chest pain, dizziness, muscular soreness, polyuria, night sweats and renal stones. However, neck ultrasound revealed no significantly abnormal thyroid or parathyroid nodules. Tc99m methoxyisobutylisonitrile (Tc99m-MIBI) scintigraphy scanning indicated an ectopic mediastinal parathyroid adenoma. Histopathological examination revealed PTCA, and the tumor tissue was coproducing PTH and PTHrP. The patient underwent successful surgical operation. Serum calcium and PTH levels remained within normal ranges, and there was no tumor recurrence observed at a 3-year follow-up appointment. Although rare, ectopic parathyroid glands may lead to malignant disease. Clinical symptoms, biochemical tests, ultrasound and Tc99m-MIBI scintigraphy scanning may assist with the diagnosis of this disease. Hypersecretion of PTHrP and PTH contributed collaboratively to the pathogenesis of hypercalcemia due to PTCA. Complete surgical resection with microscopically negative margins is the recommended treatment for PTCA and offers the best chance of a cure. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Two previous studies (<10 patients each) have demonstrated that alkali therapy may reduce urine calcium excretion in patients with calcium oxalate nephrolithiasis. The hypothesized mechanisms are (1) a decrease in bone turnover due to systemic alkalinization by the medications; (2) binding of calcium by citrate in the gastrointestinal tract; (3) direct effects on TRPV5 activity in the distal tubule. We performed a retrospective review of patients on potassium citrate therapy to evaluate the effects of this medication on urinary calcium excretion. A retrospective review was performed of a metabolic stone database at a tertiary care academic hospital. Patients were identified with a history of calcium oxalate nephrolithiasis and hypocitraturia who were on potassium citrate therapy for a minimum of 3 months. 24-h urine composition was assessed prior to the initiation of potassium citrate therapy and after 3 months of therapy. Patients received 30–60 mEq potassium citrate by mouth daily. Inclusion criterion was a change in urine potassium of 20 mEq/day or greater, which suggests compliance with potassium citrate therapy. Paired t test was used to compare therapeutic effect. Twenty-two patients were evaluated. Mean age was 58.8 years (SD 14.0), mean BMI was 29.6 kg/m2 (SD 5.9), and gender prevalence was 36.4 % female:63.6 % male. Mean pre-treatment 24-h urine values were as follows: citrate 280.0 mg/day, potassium 58.7 mEq/day, calcium 216.0 mg/day, pH 5.87. Potassium citrate therapy was associated with statistically significant changes in each of these parameters—citrate increased to 548.4 mg/day (p < 0.0001), potassium increased to 94.1 mEq/day (p < 0.0001), calcium decreased to 156.5 mg/day (p = 0.04), pH increased to 6.47 (p = 0.001). Urine sodium excretion was not different pre- and post-therapy (175 mEq/day pre-therapy versus 201 mEq/day post-therapy, p = NS). Urinary calcium excretion decreased by a mean of 60 mg/day on potassium citrate therapy—a nearly 30 % decrease in urine calcium excretion. These data lend support to the hypothesis that alkali therapy reduces urine calcium excretion. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Analytical techniques have been used to determine constituents of urinary stones of different breeds of dogs obtained from the College of Veterinary Science and Animal Husbandry, Anand Agricultural University, India. Analysis by powder XRD, FTIR and TGA suggests the presence of pure phases such as calcium oxalate monohydrate, struvite and calcium carbonate, and also mixed phases containing calcium oxalate hydrate, struvite, whewellite and weddellite in the urinary calculi. The morphology of the constituents has been studied by optical and scanning electron microscope. Activation energy and order of reaction for thermal elimination of H<inf>2</inf>O, CO and CO<inf>2</inf> have been determined. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Urolithiasis in children occurs with the incidence of 0.1-5%. Risk factors such as metabolic disorders, recurrent urinary tract infections and/or congenital abnormalities of urinary tract are detected in 75-85% of children with urolithiasis. Staghorn calculi is associated with delayed diagnosis and treatment of urinary tract infection caused by specific organisms, which produce the enzyme urease, promoting generation of ammonia and hydroxide from urea. We present two boys with staghorn calculi recognized in 8th and 31st month of age. The reason for performing ultrasonography was urinary tract infection in both boys. The younger child was previously healthy, with no symptoms of urolithiasis, the older one had recurrent urinary tract infections caused by Proteus mirabilis, episodes of anxiety and abdominal pain. Laboratory test and imaging studies excluded congenital abnormalities in the urinary tract and typical metabolic causes of urolithiasis in both boys. Treatment of infection-related stones in the younger child included two extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy (ESWL). In the older child, both ESWL and operation were performed. Staghorn calculi were composed of mixtures of magnesium ammonium phosphate (struvite) and calcium carbonate (apatite) and confirmed to be identified as infection-related stones. During follow-up in a nephrology outpatient clinic, values of blood pressure, renal ultrasonography, kidney function test were normal and no symptoms of urinary tract infections were clinically present. In patients with recurrent urinary tract infections, urolithiasis should be taken into consideration. The majority of staghorn calculi is often asymptomatic and can be diagnosed with an ultrasonography study performed routine or during urinary tract infection.

AB  - Background & Aims Chemopreventive strategies might be used to reduce the recurrence of colorectal adenomas and the incidence of colorectal cancer. We performed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to determine whether a combination of acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), calcitriol, and calcium carbonate could prevent colorectal adenoma recurrence. Methods We included 1107 patients with 1 or more sporadic adenoma(s) removed from the colon or rectum at centers in Europe, Russia, or the United States, from 2004 through 2010. Inclusion criteria were 1 adenoma greater than 1 cm in diameter, more than 1 adenoma of any size, or an adenoma of any size and first-degree relatives with colorectal cancer. Subjects were assigned randomly to groups given 0.5 μg calcitriol, 75 mg acetylsalicylic acid, and 1250 mg calcium carbonate (n = 209), or placebo (n = 218), each day for 3 years. The primary outcome was adenoma recurrence assessed by colonoscopy after 3 years. Secondary outcomes were the proportion of patients with advanced adenomas, the total number of colorectal adenomas, and adenoma size and features. Results The trial was stopped in October 2010 because of futility. In this analysis, we found no differences between groups in the rate of recurrence (odds ratio [OR], 0.95; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.61-1.48), adverse effects, or secondary outcomes. Subgroup analyses indicated that the treatment effects may be influenced by smoking status (nonsmokers OR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.26-1.22 vs current smokers OR, 1.70; 95% CI, 0.70-4.09; P value interaction <.05). However, the overall interaction was not significant. Conclusions In a prospective study, the combination of calcitriol, aspirin, and calcium carbonate did not prevent recurrence of colorectal adenomas over a 3-year period. The negative results might be owing to the effects of smoking or low doses of the tested agents. Clinicaltrials.gov number: NCT00486512. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Obesity, defined as a body mass index over 30 kg/m2 for adults, poses a major healthcare challenge with important economic, personal and social consequences. Although public health measures, lifestyle change and pharmacological therapies have an important role in the management of obesity, patients with established morbid obesity (body mass index over 40 kg/m2) may also require bariatric surgery. Bariatric or metabolic surgery is associated with effective and enduring weight loss but is also known to improve glucose homeostasis, blood pressure and dyslipidaemia. Patients who have bariatric surgery need lifelong clinical follow-up to identify and prevent nutritional deficiencies and other complications. Clinical biochemistry laboratories have an important role in the nutritional assessment of obese patients and in the identification of complications following bariatric surgery. The aim of this article is to review the different bariatric procedures available and to summarize their complications, especially nutrient deficiencies and those of particular relevance to clinical biochemistry laboratories. © 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Infected kidney stones refer to stones that form because of urinary tract infections with urease-producing bacteria, secondarily infected stones of any composition, or stones obstructing the urinary tract leading to pyelonephritis. The mainstay of treatment of infection stones is complete stone removal. Kidney stones that obstruct the urinary tract and cause obstructive pyelonephritis are also frequently referred to as infected stones. Obstructive pyelonephritis is a urologic emergency as it can result in sepsis and even death. Infection stones and obstructive stones causing pyelonephritis are different disease processes, and their workup and management are described separately. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Kidney and bladder stones (urinary tract stones) and osteoporosis are prevalent, serious conditions for postmenopausal women. Men with kidney stones are at increased risk of osteoporosis; however, the relationship of urinary tract stones to osteoporosis in postmenopausal women has not been established. The purpose of this study was to determine whether urinary tract stones are an independent risk factor for changes in bone mineral density (BMD) and incident fractures in women in the Women's Health Initiative (WHI). Data were obtained from 150,689 women in the Observational Study and Clinical Trials of the WHI with information on urinary tract stones status: 9856 of these women reported urinary tract stones at baseline and/or incident urinary tract stones during follow-up. Cox regression models were used to determine the association of urinary tract stones with incident fractures and linear mixed models were used to investigate the relationship of urinary tract stones with changes in BMD that occurred during WHI. Follow-up was over an average of 8 years. Models were adjusted for demographic and clinical factors, medication use, and dietary histories. In unadjusted models there was a significant association of urinary tract stones with incident total fractures (HR 1.10; 95% CI, 1.04 to 1.17). However, in covariate adjusted analyses, urinary tract stones were not significantly related to changes in BMD at any skeletal site or to incident fractures. In conclusion, urinary tract stones in postmenopausal women are not an independent risk factor for osteoporosis. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: This study was conducted to evaluate the chemical composition of eight types of urinary calculi using spiral computerized tomography (CT) in vivo. Methods: From October 2011 to February 2013, upper urinary tract calculi were obtained from 122 patients in the department of urinary surgery of the First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University. All patients were scanned with a 64-detector row helical CT scanner using 6.50 mm collimation before ureterorenoscopy. Data from the preoperative spiral CT scans and postoperative chemical composition of urinary calculi were collected. Results: The chemical composition analysis indicates that there were five types of pure calculi and three types of mixed calculi, including 39 calcium oxalate calculi, 12 calcium phosphate calculi, 10 calcium carbonate calculi, 8 magnesium ammonium phosphate calculi, 6 carbonated apatite, 21 uric acid/ammonium urate calculi, 10 uric acid/calcium oxalate calculi, and 16 calcium oxalate/calcium phosphate calculi. There were significant differences in the mean CT values among the five types of pure calculi (P < 0.001). Furthermore, we also observed significant differences in the mean CT values among three types of mixed calculi (P < 0.001). Significant differences in the mean CT values were also found among eight types of urinary calculi (P < 0.001). However, no statistically significant difference was observed between the mean CT values of magnesium ammonium phosphate calculi and uric acid/calcium oxalate calculi (P = 0.262). Conclusion: Our findings suggest that spiral CT could be a promising tool for determining the chemical composition of upper urinary tract calculi. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Uric acid stone is the most comment radiolucent renal stone with high recurrence rate, which would further cause acute upper urinary tract obstruction and kidney failure. Here we report two cases of renal uric acid stone from December 2012 to April 2013. One 43-year-old male patient suffered from chronic uric acid nephrolithiasis caused by the long-term indwelling of bilateral double-J stent. Another 69-year-old patient was also diagnosed with uric acid nephrolithiasis at the right kidney. Both patients were first treated with extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL), followed by 1.5% sodium bicarbonate dissolution therapy. After a week of the treatment, the uric acid stones in both patients were completely dissolved without retrograde infection. In summary, the use of ESWL and sodium bicarbonate dissolution therapy as a combined modality is a safe, effective, inexpensive treatment for uric acid nephrolithiasis. © 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Objective—To identify demographic or signalment factors associated with calcium carbonate urolith formation in goats. Design—Retrospective case series and case-control study. Animals—354 goats with calcium carbonate uroliths (case animals) and 16,366 goats without urinary tract disease (control animals). Procedures—Medical records of the Minnesota Urolith Center were reviewed to identify case goats for which samples were submitted between January 1, 1984, and December 31, 2012. Control goats evaluated at US veterinary teaching hospitals in the same time period were identified by searching Veterinary Medical Database records. Age, breed, sex, reproductive status, geographic location, season, and anatomic location of collected uroliths were analyzed to identify risk or protective factors associated with calcium carbonate urolithiasis. Results—Nigerian dwarf goats had higher odds of developing calcium carbonate uroliths than did Pygmy goats (reference group). Several breeds had lower odds of this finding, compared with Pygmy goats; odds were lowest for mixed, Anglo-Nubian, and Toggenburg breeds. Breeds of African origin (Pygmy, Nigerian Dwarf, and Boer) comprised 146 of 275 (53%) case goats with data available. Goats of African descent had a higher risk of developing calcium carbonate uroliths than did goats of non-African descent (reference group). Males and neutered goats had higher odds of calcium carbonate urolithiasis, compared with females and sexually intact goats, respectively. Age category, geographic location, and season were associated with detection of calcium carbonate uroliths. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance—Goats with calcium carbonate uroliths were typically neutered males, > 1 year of age, and of African descent. This study identified factors associated with calcium carbonate urolithiasis in goats; however, these associations do not allow conclusions regarding cause-and-effect relationships. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Carbonic anhydrases are a group of isoenzymes that catalyze the reversible conversion of carbon dioxide into bicarbonate. They participate in a constellation of physiological processes in humans, including respiration, bone metabolism, and the formation of body fluids, including urine, bile, pancreatic juice, gastric secretion, saliva, aqueous humor, cerebrospinal fluid, and sweat. In addition, carbonic anhydrase may provide carbon dioxide/bicarbonate to carboxylation reactions that incorporate carbon dioxide to substrates. Several isoforms of carbonic anhydrase have been identified in humans, but their precise physiological role and the consequences of their dysfunction are mostly unknown. Carbonic anhydrase isoenzymes are involved in calcification processes in a number of biological systems, including the formation of calcareous spicules from sponges, the formation of shell in some animals, and the precipitation of calcium salts induced by several microorganisms, particularly urease-producing bacteria. In human tissues, carbonic anhydrase is implicated in calcification processes either directly by facilitating calcium carbonate deposition which in turn serves to facilitate calcium phosphate mineralization, or indirectly via its action upon γ-glutamyl-carboxylase, a carboxylase that enables the biological activation of proteins involved in calcification, such as matrix Gla protein, bone Gla protein, and Gla-rich protein. Carbonic anhydrase is implicated in calcification of human tissues, including bone and soft-tissue calcification in rheumatological disorders such as ankylosing spondylitis and dermatomyositis. Carbonic anhydrase may be also involved in bile and kidney stone formation and carcinoma-associated microcalcifications. The aim of this review is to evaluate the possible association between carbonic anhydrase isoenzymes and vascular calcification in humans. © 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Milk of calcium (MOC) is a rare type of stone that was first described in 1940 by Ludin and Howald who reported MOC in renal cysts. Milk of calcium is a viscous colloidal suspension of calcium salts. Stasis, obstruction and infection are important predisposing factors. Due to a layering effect, characteristic radiological signs especially in CT can help in diagnosis to avoid unsuccessful shock wave lithotripsy. This is the largest reported case series, in which radiological signs by CT scan to predict renal MOC stones, clinical picture and management outcome are described in detail. Cases with suspected renal milk of calcium stones were studied over 7 years (2008–2015). All cases were diagnosed preoperatively by non-contrast CT. Urine cultures were performed in all patients preoperatively. Intra-operative and postoperative findings were reported. Stones retrieved were sent for chemical analysis using an infrared method. Seven cases of milk of calcium renal stones were included in this study. These stones were faint radio-opaque in two cases and radiolucent in five cases. All cases were diagnosed preoperatively with non-contrast CT. Their Hounsfield units (HU) ranged from 114 to 612. All stones were located in a dependent position (gravitational effect) in the posterior aspect of dilated calyces. Five cases exhibited the typical fluid level and two cases demonstrated semilunar (half moon) pattern in the anterior surface of the stones. All cases underwent PCNL with suction and retrieval of soft stones without the need for disintegration. When stones demonstrate a low Hounsfield unit, are arranged in dependent positions within dilated calyces and exhibit fluid level or semilunar pattern on non-contrast CT, milk of calcium stones should be considered. PCNL is an effective modality for management of renal milk of calcium stones. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Antiretroviral therapy initiation for HIV-1 infection is associated with 2% to 6% loss of bone mineral density (BMD). Objective: To evaluate the effect of vitamin D3 plus calcium supplementation on bone loss associated with antiretroviral therapy initiation. Design: 48-week prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01403051) Setting: 39 AIDS Clinical Trials Group units. Patients: Adults with antiretroviral therapy-naive HIV. Measurements: BMD by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, 25- hydroxyvitamin D levels, and other laboratory assessments. Results: 165 eligible patients were randomly assigned (79 received vitamin D3 plus calcium and 86 received placebo). The study groups were well-balanced at baseline: 90% were men, 33% were non-Hispanic black, and the median CD4 count was 0.341 × 109 cells/L. At 48 weeks, the percentage of decline in total hip BMD was smaller in the vitamin D3 plus calcium group than in the placebo group: Medians were -1.36% (interquartile range [IQR], -3.43% to 0.50%) and -3.22% (IQR, -5.56% to -0.88%), respectively (P = 0.004). Similar results were seen at the lumbar spine. At 48 weeks, 90% of patients achieved HIV-1 RNA levels less than 50 copies/mL. Levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 increased with vitamin D3 plus calcium but not with placebo: Median change was 61.2 nmol/L (IQR, 36.4 to 94.3) versus 1.7 nmol/L (IQR, -13.2 to 10.7) (P ≤ 0.001). Overall, 103 patients (62%) reported 1 or more adverse event, with similar distribution between groups; no cases of hypercalcemia and 1 case of nephrolithiasis were reported in the placebo group. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Inspired by the observation that crystalline calcium carbonate and calcium phosphate biominerals frequently form via amorphous precursors, a wide range of studies have been performed which demonstrate that many inorganic crystals can precipitate from solution via amorphous phases. This article considers the crystallization mechanism of calcium oxalate, which is a significant biomineral in many plants and the primary constituent of kidney stones in vertebrates, and shows that this can also precipitate via an amorphous precursor phase from aqueous solution. A range of approaches were employed to study calcium oxalate formation, including precipitation in bulk solution in the presence and absence of additives and in the spatially confined volumes offered by track etched membranes and a crossed cylinders apparatus. A freeze concentration method was also used to generate sufficient quantities of amorphous calcium oxalate (ACO) for analysis. The results show that amorphous calcium oxalate crystallizes rapidly in bulk solution but can be significantly stabilized through the concerted activity of additives and confinement. We also demonstrate that ACO has a composition of ≈CaC<inf>2</inf>O<inf>4</inf>:H<inf>2</inf>O. These data suggest that calcium oxalate biominerals, in common with their carbonate and phosphate counterparts, may also precipitate via amorphous phases. © 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Topiramate has been associated with metabolic acidosis secondary to decreased serum bicarbonate. Product labeling recommends serum bicarbonate monitoring at baseline and periodically thereafter. Objective: The study objective was to assess changes in serum bicarbonate within the first year of topiramate use in an outpatient veteran population. Methods: This was a single-center, retrospective study conducted at the Iowa City Veterans Affairs Health Care System. Inclusion criteria required a minimum of 1 topiramate outpatient prescription between October 1, 1999, and August 31, 2012, and at least 1 serum bicarbonate level within 12 months prior to topiramate initiation. Patients with topiramate nonadherence, concurrent use of sodium bicarbonate or oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, and individual serum bicarbonate values obtained during inpatient hospitalizations were excluded. Change in bicarbonate was evaluated using a paired t test. Decreases in bicarbonate of ≥5 mEq/L, values <20 mEq/L, days to lowest value, and correlation between adverse drug reactions (ADRs) and topiramate discontinuation were evaluated. Results: Of 546 patients reviewed, 350 were included in the analysis. There was a statistically significant decrease of 2.7 mEq/L in bicarbonate following initiation of topiramate. Only 1 patient had a bicarbonate value <17 mEq/L. There was no association between bicarbonate decrease ≥5 mEq/L and ADRs. Conclusions: A statistically significant reduction in bicarbonate levels occurred with topiramate, which was clinically insignificant. ADR occurrence did not correlate with bicarbonate levels <17 mEq/L or a decrease ≥5 mEq/L. Our results indicate that serum bicarbonate levels should only be monitored before topiramate initiation and in patients presenting with symptoms suggestive of acidosis. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Calcium pyrophosphate dehydrate (CPPD) crystal deposition disease (also known as chondrocalcinosis, CC) is a rare metabolic arthropathy mostly seen in elderly patients. Chondrocalcinosis may be associated with metabolic diseases such as hypomagnesemia when it occurs in young people. We report here a case with hypomagnesemia due to familial hypomagnesemia with hypercalciuria and nephrocalcinosis (FHHNC) who developed CC during clinical follow-up. To our best knowledge this is the first case of a young patient with CPPD associated with FHHNC. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Osteitis fibrosa cystica (OFC), a relatively rare skeletal disorder caused by excess parathyroid hormone, is often misdiagnosed as a neoplasm. A summary of the diagnostic procedures and treatment protocols, especially the indications for orthopedic surgery, is helpful to avoid overtreatment. Methods: Eight patients from the Orthopedic Department of Qilu Hospital of Shandong University diagnosed with OFC caused by primary hyperparathyroidism were treated, and the clinical manifestations, biochemical and radiography examination findings, surgeries and prognoses were recorded. Results: All cases (5 female and 3 male) were admitted to our department with the complaint of bone pain (5/8) or fracture after mild trauma (3/8). Biochemical screening revealed hypercalcemia and high parathyroid hormone of varying levels. Two cases were misdiagnosed as primary bone lesion and metastasis. All cases were treated with parathyroidectomy and experienced spontaneous and progressive regression of the boney disease. Four cases underwent orthopedic surgery. Bone biopsies were necessary to exclude malignant tumors, especially with orthopedic procedures. Conclusions: OFC can easily be misdiagnosed in orthopedic patients because of a lack of radiological and histologic specificity. Reaching the correct diagnosis requires a combination of clinical manifestations, routine biochemical screenings, radiographic examinations of bone and parathyroid and bone biopsy. It is generally acknowledged that parathyroidectomy is effective, but orthopedic surgery is sometimes necessary after a correct diagnosis and parathyroidectomy. However, the indications for orthopedic surgery must be strictly controlled to avoid overtreatment. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - ObjectivesTo examine the differences in 24-h urine composition between nephrolithiasis patients with and without diabetes mellitus (DM) in a large cohort of stone-formers and to examine differences in stone composition between patients with and without DM. Patients and Methods A retrospective review of 1117 patients with nephrolithiasis and a 24-h urine analysis was completed. Univariable analysis of 24-h urine profiles and multivariable linear regression models were performed, comparing patients with and without DM. A subanalysis of patients with stone analysis data available was performed, comparing the stone composition of patients with and without DM. Results Of the 1117 patients who comprised the study population, 181 (16%) had DM and 936 (84%) did not have DM at the time of urine analysis. Univariable analysis showed significantly higher total urine volume, citrate, uric acid (UA), sodium, potassium, sulphate, oxalate, chloride, and supersaturation (SS) of UA in individuals with DM (all P < 0.05). However, patients with DM had significantly lower SS of calcium phosphate and pH (all P < 0.05). Multivariable analysis showed that patients with DM had significantly lower urinary pH and SS of calcium phosphate, but significantly greater citrate, UA, sulphate, oxalate, chloride, SSUA, SS of calcium oxalate, and volume than patients without DM (all P < 0.05). Patients with DM had a significantly greater proportion of UA in their stones than patients without DM (50.2% vs 13.5%, P < 0.001). Conclusions DM was associated with multiple differences on 24-h urine analysis compared with those without DM, including significantly higher UA and oxalate, and lower pH. Control of urinary UA and pH, as well as limiting intake of dietary oxalate may reduce stone formation in patients with DM. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: The role of dual-energy computed tomography (DECT) in characterization of urinary calculi is evolving and literature regarding differentiation of calcium calculi is sparse and confounding. Purpose: To evaluate the capability of DECT in assessing the urinary calculi composition in vivo, especially in differentiating various types of calcium calculi. Material and Methods: One hundred and twenty patients underwent DECT for characterization of urinary calculi. Seventy patients with 114 calculi, including 93 calcium stones, were retrospectively analyzed. DE ratios and attenuation differences were compared using ANOVA and receiver-operating-characteristic (ROC) analysis was done to predict cut-off values, in particular for detecting calcium-oxalate-monohydrate (COM) stones. Results: DE ratio ≤1.14 accurately detected uric acid calculi, ≥1.29 was definitive for calcium and intermediate values were characteristic of cystine stones. DE ratios were significantly different between group 1 (COM [n = 32]; mean 1.376±0.041), group 2 ([calcium oxalate dihydrate (COD) + COM] [n = 51]; 1.416±0.048), and group 3 ([carbonate apatite (CaP) + COD + COM] [n= 10]; 1.468±0.038) (group 1 vs. 2, P = 0.001; 1 vs. 3, P = 0.000; 2 vs. 3, P = 0.004). More importantly, pure COM calculi (group 1) had significantly lower DE ratio compared with mixed calcium calculi (groups 2 and 3) (P = 0.000). Attenuation differences (between low and high kV images) could not distinguish between COM and mixed calculi. ROC analysis for detection of COM calculi yielded AUC of 0.770 with cut-off DE ratio 1.385 (sensitivity 65.6%, specificity 82%) and value <1.335 was seen only with COM calculi (100% specificity). Conclusion: DECT can be employed for in vivo differentiation of various types of calculi and for detection of relatively lithotripsy-resistant COM calculi. © 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Hypercalcaemia during pregnancy is uncommon, and mostly associated with primary hyperparathyroidism (pHPT). If unrecognised, it poses a significant risk for the mother and the foetus. Maternal symptoms include: hyperemesis, muscle weakness, pancreatitis, nephrolithiasis, bone disease, mental status changes, and hypercalcaemic crisis. Untreated disease complicates foetal development and foetal death is a significant risk. Our case illustrates the difficulty in detecting pHPT during pregnancy, serious complications connected with severe hypercalcaemia, and difficulties in preparing the patient for surgical treatment. Our review of the medical literature did not identify any previous case of a pregnant woman with hypercalcaemic crisis (total calcium 17 mg/dL, parathyroid hormone 2302 pg/mL), acute pancreatitis caused by pHPT, and with hyperthyroidism, who had undergone a successful surgical treatment. © 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Objective: Carbonic anhydrase (CA) II deficiency is a rare autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutation in the CA II gene that leads to osteopet-rosis, renal tubular acidosis (RTA), and cerebral calcification. Our aim is to present a patient with the classic triad of CA II deficiency syndrome to enhance the awareness about this rare syndrome. Methods: We describe the clinical and radiological findings of a Saudi woman patient with CA II deficiency syndrome. Results: A Saudi woman in her 20s presented to our hospital for evaluation of increased bone density. She was known to have delayed developmental milestone with growth retardation and poor scholastic performance. She had multiple fragile fractures started at the age of 15 involving the lower extremi-ties. A physical examination revealed dysmorphic features and intellectual disability with intelligence quotient (IQ) of 36. The initial blood workup showed a picture of distal RTA with hypokalemia, and the radiological imaging confirmed the presence of osteopetrosis and multiple kidney stones. The com-bination of osteopetrosis with RTA raised the possibility of CA II deficiency. Therefore, computed tomography (CT) of the brain was done and showed intracranial calcification involving the basal ganglia. She was started on potassium chloride and sodium bicarbonate. In addition, she underwent right-sided percutaneous nephrolithotripsy. Her DNA analysis came to show a sequence variant c.232+1G.A, which was detected in both of the CA II genes (homozygous). Conclusion: Early recognition of the disease is a key, as an early appropriate treatment institution is essential in order to prevent further complications. © 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Kidney stone disease is a polygenic and multifactorial disorder with a worldwide distribution, and its incidence and prevalence are increasing. Although significant progress has been made in recent years towards identifying the specific factors that contribute to the formation of kidney stone, many questions on the pathogenesis of kidney stones remain partially or completely unanswered. However, none of the proposed mechanisms specifically consider the role(s) of the trace elements and, consequently, the contribution of trace constituents to the pathogenesis of kidney stones remains unclear and under debate. The findings of some studies seem to support a role for some major and trace elements in the initiation of stone crystallization, including as a nucleus or nidus for the formation of the stone or simply as a contaminant of the stone structure. Thus, the analysis of kidney stones is an important component of investigations on nephrolithiasis in order to understand the role of trace constituents in the formation of kidney stones and to formulate future strategies for the treatment and prevention of stone formation and its recurrence. The aim of this review is to compare and evaluate the methods/procedures commonly used in the analysis of urinary calculi. We also highlight the role of major and trace elements in the pathogenesis of kidney stones. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Uric acid is 11 times more soluble at pH 6.5 than at pH 5.0. For this reason, uric acid stone formation usually requires a persistently acid urinary pH. Conversely, raising the urinary pH with alkaline salts can frequently dissolve an existing calculus as long as free flow of urine past the stone can be established. This chapter outlines the clinical situations in which uric acid stones occur and provides a description of the medical therapy for dissolving and preventing this type of calculus. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Stone disease in patients with spinal cord injury is a source of morbidity and mortality. Previous studies have indicated a decrease in infection-based urolithiasis in recent decades. We aimed to identify changes in stone composition and surgical outcomes in patients with para and quadriplegia over time. A retrospective review of para and quadriplegic patients from 1986 to 2011 who underwent surgical intervention for urolithiasis was performed, identifying 95 patients. The Mantel–Haenszel Chi square test was used to compare change in stone composition over time. The mean patient age was 44.0 years (range 18–88) and treatment included percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) 40 (42.1 %), ureteroscopy 28 (29.5 %), shock wave lithotripsy (SWL) 26 (27.4 %), and nephrectomy 1 (1 %). Overall stone-free status was found in 47.4 % with 19.0 % requiring a repeat procedure. The median hospital stay for patients undergoing SWL was 2.5 days, ureteroscopy 5 days, and PCNL 6 days. Infection-based stone composition was identified in 23 patients (36.5 %). We evaluated the linear change in percent of each stone component over time and identified increasing components of calcium oxalate dihydrate (p = 0.002) and calcium carbonate (p = 0.009). However, over a period of 25 years, the incidence of infection-based stone did not change (p = 0.57). Para and quadriplegic patients with urolithiasis can be difficult to treat surgically with prolonged hospitalizations, low stone-free status, and often require additional procedures. Despite improvements in antibiotic agents and management of neurogenic bladders, infection-based calculi continue to be a significant source of morbidity to this patient population. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Urolithiasis is a well-known disease of the urogenital system in domestic animals, and it has also been described in captive and free-ranging wildlife. This article reports 15 cases of urolithiasis in a captive group of Tammar wallabies (Macropus eugenii) between 2004 and 2011. The analyzed stones were composed of pure calcium carbonate (n=5), calcium carbonate with traces of calcium phosphate (n=6), carbonate apatite (n=2), and carbonate apatite mixed with calcium oxalate (n=2). In 12 out of 15 cases uroliths were situated only in the renal pelvis; in two cases they were found in the renal pelvis and the ureter; while in one case in the ureter only. No common infectious agents were identified either by microbiological or histopathological methods. Although the exact cause remains unknown, the repetitive occurrence of calcium carbonate urolithiasis suggests husbandry-related causes. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first report on recurrent appearance of urolithiasis in a captive group of Tammar wallabies.

AB  - Equine urolithiasis was first described in 1840 as a pathological case. Urolithiasis in horses is an uncommon clinical entity, despite some known predisposing factors. Geldings older than 10 years of age appear to be the most susceptible. The exact aetiology of urolithiasis is not elucidated, but two conditions seem to be necessary for calculus formation: nucleation and crystal growth. The factors that contribute to nucleation are inflammatory processes (cystitis, pyelonephritis) and cell necrosis; while those that contribute to crystal growth are supersaturation, high calcium content and pH. Two types of calculi occur in horses, which are mostly composed of calcium carbonate. The more common type is sphere-shaped, soft and yellow-green coloured with a spiculated surface. The other form is smooth-surfaced, firm, white or gray and more irregular in shape. Diagnosis of urolithiasis is often challenging because the clinical signs may be non specific (poor performance, chronic weight loss) or rarely specific (stranguria, haematuria). Supplementary examinations (laboratory tests of blood and urine, ultrasonography, cystoscopy) should be performed. Several surgical techniques have been described to treat equine urolithiasis. The most appropriate method should be selected according to the size and position of the urolith, the surgeon's skill and the available surgical equipment. Techniques for laparocystotomy, perineal urethrotomy, pararectal cystotomy and nephrectomy are reviewed in this paper. The authors summarise the most recent knowledge about the methods of lithotripsy, the possibilities of postoperative treatment, the analysis of uroliths and the prevention of urolithiasis. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The NaHCO<inf>3</inf> cotransporter NBCn1 plays a role in neutralizing intracellular acid loads at the basolateral membrane in cells of the medullary thick ascending limb (mTAL). Calcineurin inhibitors (Cn-Is) are known to both downregulate NBCn1 expression in the distal nephron and cause renal tubular acidosis (RTA), a risk factor for nephrocalcinosis and nephrolithiasis. In this report, we provide a new perspective on concurrent studies of NBCn1 in various tissues by using cell-free binding assays to investigate the interaction of NBCn1 with the calcineurin (Cn) isoform PPP3CA. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analyses show that the protein domain Exon 7 (translated from cassette II of NBCn1) binds Cn with an equilibrium dissociation constant (K<inf>D</inf>) of 30 +/- 15 nm. Linked-reaction tests suggest that the binding involves a conformational change. Nested PCR reactions were used to show that NBCn1-Exon 7 splice variants with alternative N-termini regions are expressed in the kidney, as well as other tissues. Additionally, we discuss NBCn1-Exon 7 implication in acid-base balance and calcium crystallization in the kidney. © Ivyspring International Publisher. © 2014 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Objective: Hypoparathyroidism is a rare disease caused by lack of parathyroid hormone (PTH) leading to hypocalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, and a variety of symptoms. This study aimed to quantify the clinical and social burden of illness from the perspective of affected patients.Methods: A web-based instrument was developed with input from patients, clinical experts, and the Hypoparathyroidism Association. Qualifying participants were ≥18 years old, diagnosed with hypoparathyroidism for ≥6 months, and U.S. residents. Questions focused on demographics, diagnosis perceptions, current attitudes, medical management, current symptoms, acute episodes, comorbidities, personal life, and employment.Results: A total of 374 adults (mean age, 49 ± 12 years; female, 85%) with hypoparathyroidism (mean duration, 13 ± 12 years; severe condition, 30.5%) completed the survey. Patients reported visiting a mean of 6 ± 8 physicians before and after their diagnosis. The majority strongly agreed with feeling unprepared to manage the condition at diagnosis (56%), that controlling their hypoparathyroidism is harder than expected (60%), and that they were concerned about long-term complications of their current medications (75%). More than 10 symptoms were experienced by 72%of patients in the preceding 12 months, despite current management regimens. Symptoms were experienced for a mean of 13 ± 9 hours/day. Hospital stays or emergency department visits were required by 79%of patients. 45%reported significant interference with their lives, 85%reported an inability to perform household activities, and 20%experienced a disease-associated change in employment status.Conclusion: Patients with hypoparathyroidism have a high burden of illness and experience a broad spectrum of symptoms, with a multidimensional impact on their lives. © 2014 AACE. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS) primarily occurs after rapid correction of severe hyponatremia. There are no proven effective therapies for ODS, but we describe the first case showing the successful treatment of central pontine myelinolysis (CPM) by plasma exchange, which occurred after rapid development of hypernatremia from intravenous sodium bicarbonate therapy. Case presentation. A 40-year-old woman presented with general weakness, hypokalemia, and metabolic acidosis. The patient was treated with oral and intravenous potassium chloride, along with intravenous sodium bicarbonate. Although her bicarbonate deficit was 365 mEq, we treated her with an overdose of intravenous sodium bicarbonate, 480 mEq for 24 hours, due to the severity of her acidemia and her altered mental status. The next day, she developed hypernatremia with serum sodium levels rising from 142.8 mEq/L to 172.8 mEq/L. Six days after developing hypernatremia, she exhibited tetraparesis, drooling, difficulty swallowing, and dysarthria, and a brain MRI revealed high signal intensity in the central pons with sparing of the peripheral portion, suggesting CPM. We diagnosed her with CPM associated with the rapid development of hypernatremia after intravenous sodium bicarbonate therapy and treated her with plasma exchange. After two consecutive plasma exchange sessions, her neurologic symptoms were markedly improved except for mild diplopia. After the plasma exchange sessions, we examined the patient to determine the reason for her symptoms upon presentation to the hospital. She had normal anion gap metabolic acidosis, low blood bicarbonate levels, a urine pH of 6.5, and a calyceal stone in her left kidney. We performed a sodium bicarbonate loading test and diagnosed distal renal tubular acidosis (RTA). We also found that she had Sjögren's syndrome after a positive screen for anti-Lo, anti-Ra, and after the results of Schirmer's test and a lower lip biopsy. She was discharged and treated as an outpatient with oral sodium bicarbonate and potassium chloride. Conclusion: This case indicates that serum sodium concentrations should be carefully monitored in patients with distal RTA receiving intravenous sodium bicarbonate therapy. We should keep in mind that acute hypernatremia and CPM can be associated with intravenous sodium bicarbonate therapy, and that CPM due to acute hypernatremia may be effectively treated with plasma exchange. © 2014 Chang et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd. © 2014 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Introduction: The choice of ideal treatment for a given lithiasis is a crucial factor for its success, minimizing the number of interventions and complications. Previous determination of stone composition and its fragility is desirable, to predict its behavior during extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy and for evaluation of its appropriateness, or to set the indication for other techniques. OBJETIVES: To determine the role of densitometry in the prediction of composition and fragility of urinary lithiasis undergoing SWL. METHODS: Experimental prospective, blinded, in vitro study using 193 urinary calculi of known composition: monohydrated calcium oxalate, mixed calcium oxalate, uric acid, and calcium carbonate, obtained from spontaneous passage or surgery. Densitometry and SWL were performed on them. We compare the mineral composition of the stone and mineral density of each composition group to check if they are characteristic of each type and correlate these parameters with the energy dose required to fragment them down to a given fragment size. RESULTS: Only 53 out of 193 stones showed valuable data. Calcium carbonate was the composition showing grater mineral content and density (1,24 gr and 0,47 gr/cm2), followed by mixed oxalate (0,51/0,26) and uric acid ((0,52/ 0,15), finishing with the monohydrate calcium oxalate group (0,32/0,05). Only the comparison between calcium carbonate and monohydrated calcium oxalate showed statistically significant results (p<0,05). Correlation coefficients between mineral content (0,347) and density (0,424) and the energy used for stone fragmentation to a given fragment size were statistically significant (p<0,05) CONCLUSIONS: In our study, the use of densitometry to determine stone composition and lithiasic fragility did not show conclusive results due to the limited number of calculi tested. Nevertheless, there are signs that, with a different study design , more practically useful results could be achieved. © 2014 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - An inactivating mutation in the GNAS gene causes either pseudohypoparathyroidism 1a (PHP1A) when it is maternally inherited or pseudopseudohypoparathyroidism (PPHP) when it is paternally inherited. We investigated clinical manifestations and mutations of the GNAS gene in ethnic Chinese patients with PHP1A or PPHP. Seven patients from 5 families including 4 girls and 2 boys with PHP1A and 1 girl with PPHP were studied. All PHP1A patients had mental retardation. They were treated with calcitriol and CaCO3 with regular monitoring of serum Ca levels, urinary Ca/Cr ratios, and renal sonography. Among them, 5 patients also had primary hypothyroidism suggesting TSH resistance. One female patient had a renal stone which was treated with extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy. She had an increased urinary Ca/Cr ratio of 0.481 mg/mg when the stone was detected. We detected mutations using PCR and sequencing as well as analysed a splice acceptor site mutation using RT-PCR, sequencing, and minigene construct. We detected 5 mutations: c.85C>T (Q29*), c.103C>T (Q35*), c.840-2A>G (R280Sfs*21), c.1027-1028delGA (D343*), and c.1174G>A (E392K). Mutations c.840-2A>G and c.1027-1028delGA were novel. The c.840-2A>G mutation at the splice acceptor site of intron 10 caused retention of intron 10 in the minigene construct but skipping of exon 11 in the peripheral blood cells. The latter was the most probable mechanism which caused a frameshift, changing Arg to Ser at residue 280 and invoking a premature termination of translation at codon 300 (R280Sfs*21). Five GNAS mutations in ethnic Chinese with PHP1A and PPHP were reported. Two of them were novel. Mutation c.840-2A>G destroyed a spice acceptor site and caused exon skipping. Regular monitoring and adjustment in therapy are mandatory to achieve optimal therapeutic effects and avoid nephrolithiasis in patients with PHP1A. © 2014 Wu et al. © 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The objective of the present study was to investigate the matrix protein of a rare urinary stone that contained calcium carbonate. A urinary stone was extracted from a 34-year-old male patient with metabolic alkalosis. After X-ray diffractometry and infrared analysis of the stone, proteomic analysis was carried out. The resulting mass spectra were evaluated with protein search software, and matrix proteins were identified. X-ray diffraction and infrared analysis confirmed that the stone contained calcium carbonate and calcium oxalate dihydrate. Of the identified 53 proteins, 24 have not been previously reported from calcium oxalate- or calcium phosphate-containing stones. The protease inhibitors and several proteins related to cell adhesion or the cytoskeleton were identified for the first time. We analyzed in detail a rare urinary stone composed of calcium carbonate and calcium oxalate dihydrate. Considering the formation of a calcium carbonate stone, the new identified proteins should play an important role on the urolithiasis process in alkaline condition. © 2013 The Japanese Urological Association. © 2014 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Uric acid stones constitute around 10-20% of kidney stones in the general stone-forming population, but are particularly more prevalent among obese and diabetic kidney stone formers and in patients with gout. The major risk factor predisposing to uric acid stone formation is an overly acidic urine (urinary pH <5.5), while hyperuricosuria and low urine volume are less commonly observed risk factors. Since urine pH is a key determinant of uric acid solubility in urine, uric acid stones can be dissolved with urinary alkalinization. Management of uric acid stones is primarily medical - urinary alkalinization through reduction in dietary acid ash intake and supplementation with potassium citrate or sodium bicarbonate. Urological intervention is generally reserved for cases of severe obstruction, progressive decline in renal function, infection or intractable pain. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Available evidence on the effects of vitamin D on mortality has been inconclusive. In a recent systematic review, we found evidence that vitamin D<inf>3</inf> may decrease mortality in mostly elderly women. The present systematic review updates and reassesses the benefits and harms of vitamin D supplementation used in primary and secondary prophylaxis of mortality. Objectives: To assess the beneficial and harmful effects of vitamin D supplementation for prevention of mortality in healthy adults and adults in a stable phase of disease. Search methods: We searched The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, the Science Citation Index-Expanded and Conference Proceedings Citation Index-Science (all up to February 2012). We checked references of included trials and pharmaceutical companies for unidentified relevant trials. Selection criteria: Randomised trials that compared any type of vitamin D in any dose with any duration and route of administration versus placebo or no intervention in adult participants. Participants could have been recruited from the general population or from patients diagnosed with a disease in a stable phase. Vitamin D could have been administered as supplemental vitamin D (vitamin D<inf>3</inf> (cholecalciferol) or vitamin D<inf>2</inf> (ergocalciferol)) or as an active form of vitamin D (1α-hydroxyvitamin D (alfacalcidol) or 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (calcitriol)). Data collection and analysis: Six review authors extracted data independently. Random-effects and fixed-effect meta-analyses were conducted. For dichotomous outcomes, we calculated the risk ratios (RRs). To account for trials with zero events, we performed meta-analyses of dichotomous data using risk differences (RDs) and empirical continuity corrections. We used published data and data obtained by contacting trial authors. To minimise the risk of systematic error, we assessed the risk of bias of the included trials. Trial sequential analyses controlled the risk of random errors possibly caused by cumulative meta-analyses. Main results: We identified 159 randomised clinical trials. Ninety-four trials reported no mortality, and nine trials reported mortality but did not report in which intervention group the mortality occurred. Accordingly, 56 randomised trials with 95,286 participants provided usable data on mortality. The age of participants ranged from 18 to 107 years. Most trials included women older than 70 years. The mean proportion of women was 77%. Forty-eight of the trials randomly assigned 94,491 healthy participants. Of these, four trials included healthy volunteers, nine trials included postmenopausal women and 35 trials included older people living on their own or in institutional care. The remaining eight trials randomly assigned 795 participants with neurological, cardiovascular, respiratory or rheumatoid diseases. Vitamin D was administered for a weighted mean of 4.4 years. More than half of the trials had a low risk of bias. All trials were conducted in high-income countries. Forty-five trials (80%) reported the baseline vitamin D status of participants based on serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels. Participants in 19 trials had vitamin D adequacy (at or above 20 ng/mL). Participants in the remaining 26 trials had vitamin D insufficiency (less than 20 ng/mL).Vitamin D decreased mortality in all 56 trials analysed together (5,920/47,472 (12.5%) vs 6,077/47,814 (12.7%); RR 0.97 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.94 to 0.99); P = 0.02; I2 = 0%). More than 8% of participants dropped out. 'Worst-best case' and 'best-worst case' scenario analyses demonstrated that vitamin D could be associated with a dramatic increase or decrease in mortality. When different forms of vitamin D were assessed in separate analyses, only vitamin D<inf>3</inf> decreased mortality (4,153/37,817 (11.0%) vs 4,340/38,110 (11.4%); RR 0.94 (95% CI 0.91 to 0.98); P = 0.002; I2 = 0%; 75,927 participants; 38 trials). Vitamin D<inf>2</inf>, alfacalcidol and calcitriol did not significantly affect mortality. A subgroup analysis of trials at high risk of bias suggested that vitamin D<inf>2</inf> may even increase mortality, but this finding could be due to random errors. Trial sequential analysis supported our finding regarding vitamin D<inf>3</inf>, with the cumulative Z-score breaking the trial sequential monitoring boundary for benefit, corresponding to 150 people treated over five years to prevent one additional death. We did not observe any statistically significant differences in the effect of vitamin D on mortality in subgroup analyses of trials at low risk of bias compared with trials at high risk of bias; of trials using placebo compared with trials using no intervention in the control group; of trials with no risk of industry bias compared with trials with risk of industry bias; of trials assessing primary prevention compared with trials assessing secondary prevention; of trials including participants with vitamin D level below 20 ng/mL at entry compared with trials including participants with vitamin D levels equal to or greater than 20 ng/mL at entry; of trials including ambulatory participants compared with trials including institutionalised participants; of trials using concomitant calcium supplementation compared with trials without calcium; of trials using a dose below 800 IU per day compared with trials using doses above 800 IU per day; and of trials including only women compared with trials including both sexes or only men. Vitamin D<inf>3</inf> statistically significantly decreased cancer mortality (RR 0.88 (95% CI 0.78 to 0.98); P = 0.02; I2 = 0%; 44,492 participants; 4 trials). Vitamin D<inf>3</inf> combined with calcium increased the risk of nephrolithiasis (RR 1.17 (95% CI 1.02 to 1.34); P = 0.02; I2 = 0%; 42,876 participants; 4 trials). Alfacalcidol and calcitriol increased the risk of hypercalcaemia (RR 3.18 (95% CI 1.17 to 8.68); P = 0.02; I2 = 17%; 710 participants; 3 trials). Authors' conclusions: Vitamin D<inf>3</inf> seemed to decrease mortality in elderly people living independently or in institutional care. Vitamin D<inf>2</inf>, alfacalcidol and calcitriol had no statistically significant beneficial effects on mortality. Vitamin D<inf>3</inf> combined with calcium increased nephrolithiasis. Both alfacalcidol and calcitriol increased hypercalcaemia. Because of risks of attrition bias originating from substantial dropout of participants and of outcome reporting bias due to a number of trials not reporting on mortality, as well as a number of other weaknesses in our evidence, further placebo-controlled randomised trials seem warranted. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Background and purpose: Urolithiasis is one of the most common diseases of urinary tract. Abdominal colic pain, nausea and vomiting, and hematuria are the major clinical complains. Renal stones may obstruct urinary tract, and then damage the kidney. Medical treatment, removing the stones by extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy, percutaneous lithotripsy, and ureteroscopic lithotripsy are common treatments but they are expensive and may result in significant complication. The aim of this research was finding a new medication for dissolution of urinary stones with less complication and cost. Materials and methods: Variable concentrations of some fractions of the extract of Juniperus communis fruit (500, 1000 and 2000 μg/ml solutions) were used in vitro on urinary stones brought out from human kidney. Neutral (normal saline), positive (sodium bicarbonate) and negative (acetic acid) control groups were also prepared. Results: Significant findings were obtained in urinary stones composed of calcium oxalate (50%), calcium hydrogen phosphate (20%), magnesium ammonium phosphate, (10%) and ammonium urate (20%). The weight of dry powder of stones in normal saline decreased from 1458 mg to 1162, 1124, 1136, 1144, 1096, 1126, and 1130 mg after exposure to increasing concentrations of some fractions of the extract of Juniperus fruit. In addition, the ratio of calcium oxalate in normal saline aqueous solution plus stone increased from 70% to 80% after using some fractions of the extract of Juniperus fruit. Conclusion: Some fractions of the extract of Juniperus fruit can dissolve urinary stone in vitro. © 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - North east India is the richest reservoir of plant diversity in India and one of the 'biodiversity hotspot' of the world. Tripura, which is a hilly state of this region, is also rich in plant diversity. North Tripura district of Tripura is comprising of mostly forest area and of which 82.67 % population living in rural areas has high practices of traditional medicine for different disease conditions. This study on folk medicinal practice was done in order to document the existing folk drugs and treatment procedures among the peoples of North Tripura district of Tripura with a view to provide lead material for the discovery of new drugs of natural origin. For this local health practitioner, village head, elderly experienced persons were interviewed during 2012-2013 in the medico-ethno botanical survey of North Tripura and folk medicinal claims were documented. Present study reveals first-hand information on 48 folk medicinal claims having plant parts, animal products and minerals. Enumeration of the claims were arranged according to disease condition wise providing information on scientific names of the used folk drugs followed by local name, Sanskrit name, parts used, method of use with dose and duration as informed by the claimants and their relevant properties as per Ayurvedic texts. The documented folk medicinal claims have both single herb preparation and compound formulations. © 2014 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Purpose: To document the experiences of a single institution in evaluating the clinical courses and treatment outcomes of patients with cystine stones. Materials and Methods: The clinical data of 14 patients with cystine stones who were treated at our institution from March 1994 to July 2012 were reviewed. These data included age at first visit, gender, family history, body mass index, presence of a single kidney, stone locations, stone burden, routine urinalysis, and culture. In addition, we also analyzed data on surgery, shock wave lithotripsy, medical treatment, stone recurrence or regrowth, and overall treatment success rates. Results: The mean age of our patients at their first visit was 19.6±5.0 years, and eight patients were males. The median stone burden and mean urine pH before each surgery were 6.5 cm2 and 6.5±0.9, respectively. Two patients had a family history of cystine stones. Patients underwent surgery an average of 2.7 times. The median interval between surgeries was 27.3 months, and 1 open surgery, 12 percutaneous nephrolithotomies, and 25 ureterorenoscopies were performed. Potassium citrate or sodium bicarbonate was used in nine cases. D-Penicillamine was continuously used in three patients. Patients had an average incidence of 3.2 recurrences or regrowth of stones during the median follow-up period of 60.5 months. Conclusions: Patients with cystine stones have high recurrence or regrowth rates and relatively large stone burdens. Adequate treatment schedules must therefore be established in these cases to prevent possible deterioration of renal function. © The Korean Urological Association, 2014. © 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - In the present article we aim to bring forward the apparent disconnect between two US government-sponsored entities - the Institute of Medicine (IOM) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) - regarding the safe upper limit of Ca intake. In light of the 2011 US Congress-appointed IOM report indicating an upper limit of elemental Ca intake of 2000-2500 mg/d in adults (based on age group), it is perplexing that the FDA has not yet required a change on the labelling of over-the-counter Ca-containing antacids, some of which indicate an upper limit of elemental Ca intake of 2800-3000 mg/d. Even more concerning is that Ca intake is rarely from supplementation in isolation. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data from 2003-2006 indicate that mean dietary Ca intakes for males ranged from 871 to 1266 mg/d and for females from 748 to 968 mg/d depending on the age group. The estimated total Ca (diet + supplements) intake exceeded the upper limit in 5 % of the population older than 50 years. Furthermore, NHANES data from 1999-2000 indicate that when Ca is taken as part of an antacid preparation, patients often fail to report this as Ca intake. Thus, individuals taking the maximum allowable dose of supplemental Ca as antacids are at high risk for complications associated with excess Ca intake. Our hope is that by describing Ca homeostasis and highlighting the risks and dangers of Ca overload, the FDA will align its recommendation with the IOM and solve the current Ca conundrum in the USA for the sake of patient safety.

AB  - Background: The aim of the study was to investigate the interconversion of the stone chemical composition of two recurrent stone episodes in stone formers. Methods: The data of 1098 stones analyses from 549 patients with a history of two renal stone episodes were selected and reviewed. The stone composition between the two recurrent episodes of stones was compared. Results: The percent occurrences of stones caused by infection, known as infection stones, in new episodes of stones significantly increased by 7% and uric acid stones increased by 3.8% while the calcium oxalate stones decreased by 13.1% (each p <0.05). The mean recurrent interval of new episodes of stones was 34.2 months. Infection stones had a significant shorter interval time compared to calcium oxalate stones (p <0.001). On a patient-by-patient investigation, 32.9% of patients underwent conversions of stone compositions, with 31.9% and 34.1% in men and female, respectively (p =0.590). The mutual conversion of infection stones to calcium oxalate stones was most common. The 61.1% of patients with uric acid recurrent stones were composed of calcium oxalate in the previous episode of stones, and 5% and 51.7% of patients with infection stones developed stones of uric acid or calcium oxalate in the new episode, respectively. Conclusions: Alterations of stone components during follow-up were found in as high as 32.9% of patients with no gender difference. The impetus of these shifts is not readily apparent. Accurate and repeated stone analyses throughout the course of recurrent stone disease are highly warranted, which may be useful to prevent recurrence of composition-specific stones. © 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Structural and microstructural parameters of seven kidney stones (UKS1-UKS7) retrieved from patients of eastern India were investigated using FTIR spectros-copy, scanning electron microscopy, thermogravimetric analysis and X-ray powder diffractometry. Quantitative phase analysis of kidney stones was performed following the Rietveld method. Crystallite sizes and thermal stability were evaluated from the X-ray peak-broadening analysis and thermogravimetric study. Rietveld analysis of X-ray powder diffraction data indicates that kidney stones are a mixture of phases with whewellite as the major constituent in UKS1-UKS4 and UKS7, whereas the major phase in UKS5 and UKS6 is anhydrous uric acid. The crystallite size of whewellite phase in stones with more than 50 wt% of whewellite (UKS1-UKS4 and UKS7) varies from 149(5) to 182(1) nm, whereas the corresponding sizes of uric acid crystallites in stones with more than 50 wt% of uric acid (UKS5 and UKS6) are 163(2) and 190(3) nm, respectively. Thermogravimetric analysis (TG) of UKS1 reveals that whewellite is stable upto 400 K and above this temperature anhydrous calcium oxalate is formed, which tranforms into calcium carbonate at 750 K and finally to calcium oxide above 970 K. The kidney stone UKS5 with more than 90 wt% of uric acid is stable upto 708 K. © 2014 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - In the era of multidrug resistance, it is critical to utilize antibiotics in an appropriate manner and to identify new treatments or revisit the use of 'forgotten' drugs. Because urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common, particularly in an increasing elderly population, the 'forgotten' drug, methenamine, may become important as a preventive therapy for recurrent UTIs. Methenamine, a urinary antibacterial agent, can be used as methenamine hippurate or methenamine mandelate preparations and is United States Food and Drug Administration-approved. This article discusses the place of preventive therapy for recurrent UTIs, chemistry, mechanism of action, pharmacology, clinical uses, dosage, adverse reactions and safety, and drug interactions of methenamine. Because of its unique antiseptic property, the authors suggest that methenamine should be considered when more commonly used antibiotics fail to suppress recurrent UTIs. © 2014 Informa UK, Ltd. © 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - With an incidence of 1:7000 births, cystinuria, the most frequent cause of stone formation among genetic diseases, represents a major medical problem. Twenty-five cystine stones randomly selected from cystinuric patients were investigated. From a crystallographic point of view, cystine stones are composed of micrometre size crystallites, which are made up of an aggregation of nanocrystals. Through scanning electron microscopy, the morphology and size of the crystallites have been described, while the size of the nanocrystals was investigated by means of powder neutron diffraction. Powder neutron diffraction analysis and/or scanning electron microscopy examination of cystine stones provide evidence that usual alkalinization by sodium bicarbonate associated with high diuresis significantly reduces the size of both nanocrystals and crystallites, while for other treatments, including alkalinizing drugs and thiol derivatives, the data suggest mainly changes in the topology of crystallites. Alkalinization with sodium bicarbonate affects cystine kidney stones at the mesoscopic and nanoscopic scales, while other medical treatments only alter their surface. Such an approach may help to assess the interaction between drugs and cystine stones in cystinuric patients. © 2014. © 2014 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: We sought to improve lumbar spine bone mineral density (LS-BMD) in long-term survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) using calcium and cholecalciferol supplementation. Procedure: This double-blind, placebo-controlled trial randomized 275 participants (median age, 17 [9-36.1] years) with age- and gender-specific LS-BMD Z-scores <0 to receive nutritional counseling with supplementation of 1,000mg/day calcium and 800International Unit cholecalciferol or placebo for 2 years. The primary outcome was change in LS-BMD assessed by quantitative computerized tomography (QCT) at 24 months. Linear regression models were employed to identify the baseline risk factors for low LS-BMD and to compare LS-BMD outcomes. Results: Pre-randomization LS-BMD below the mean was associated with male gender (P=0.0024), White race (P=0.0003), lower body mass index (P<0.0001), and cumulative glucocorticoid doses of ≥5,000mg (P=0.0012). One hundred eighty-eight (68%) participants completed the study; 77% adhered to the intervention. Mean LS-BMD change did not differ between survivors randomized to supplements (0.33±0.57) or placebo (0.28±0.56). Participants aged 9-13 years and those 22-35 years had the greatest mean increases in LS-BMD (0.50±0.66 and 0.37±0.23, respectively). Vitamin D insufficiency (serum 25[OH]D <30ng/ml) found in 296 (75%), was not associated with LS-BMD outcomes (P=0.78). Conclusion: Cholecalciferol and calcium supplementation provides no added benefit to nutritional counseling for improving LS-BMD among adolescent and young adult survivors of ALL (93% of whom had LS-BMD Z-scores above the mean at study entry).

AB  - Background Few long-term reports with high rates of follow-up are available after gastric bypass. We report changes in weight, co-morbidity, cardiovascular risk, and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) 5 years after gastric bypass. Methods Patients who had gastric bypass (2004-2006) were included. Prospective data were reviewed. Long-term complications, cardiovascular risk factors, and HRQoL were evaluated, and the 10-year risk for coronary heart disease was estimated (Framingham risk score). Outcomes were compared in patients with body mass index (BMI)<50 and ≥50 kg/m2. Results A total of 184 of 203 patients (91%) met to follow-up. The mean±SD preoperative BMI was 46±5 kg/m2, and the mean±SD age was 38±9 years; 75% were women. Thirty-two percent of the patients had a BMI ≥50 kg/m 2, and 30% had type 2 diabetes. Follow-up was 63±5 months. After 5 years, total weight loss was 27%±11%. Remission of type 2 diabetes had occurred in 67%. The prevalence of hypertension, dyslipidemia, sleep apnea, and metabolic syndrome had decreased. HRQoL was improved. The Framingham risk score was reduced (5.6% versus 4.6%; P =.021). Sixty-one patients (33%) had long-term complications, most commonly chronic abdominal pain (10%). BMI was 33±5 and 37±7 kg/m2 in patients with preoperative BMI<50 and ≥50 kg/m2, but changes in metabolic, cardiovascular risk profile and HRQoL were broadly similar. Conclusions Beneficial effects on weight loss, cardiovascular risk, and HRQoL were documented 5 years after gastric bypass in morbidly and super-obese patients. © 2014 American Society for Bariatric Surgery. © 2014 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Patients are often bombarded with information from the internet, family, friends, and television about what is good and bad for their bones-particularly in the area of diet and nutrition. Although some information is valid and evidence based, much is not. Patients often believe that adequate nutrition alone is enough to improve bone density and decrease fragility fracture risk. Although calcium and vitamin D remain the mainstays of medical nutrition therapy, many patients are not receiving adequate counseling on how to get the right amounts of these 2 nutrients and may not understand that calcium and vitamin D are but 2 of many factors in this multifactorial disease. Clinicians must listen carefully to their patients' concerns, beliefs, and questions and help them develop a personalized plan to achieve their daily calcium and vitamin D intakes. Clinicians must stay apprised of the recent research in nutrition and bone health and evaluate the evidence to adequately educate their patients. © 2013 The International Society for Clinical Densitometry. © 2014 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.; MEDLINE® is the source for the MeSH terms of this document.

AB  - Introduction: Type 1 (distal) renal tubular acidosis (RTA) is a rare clinical condition characterized with defect of urinary acidification in distal tubulus. If diagnosis delays, RTA may cause metabolic and clinical complications and comorbidities. We describe here a type 1 distal RTA case with symptoms mimicking coronary ischemia. Case report: A 46-year-old woman admitted with complaints of chest pain, palpitation, walking disability, fatigue and nausea. On physical examination muscles were weaken 3/5 in four extremities. An electrocardiogram revealed supraventricular tachycardia and ST depression on precordial V2-6 derivations. An acute coronary syndrome diagnosis made based on anginal symptoms, supraventricular tachycardia, ST depression on V2-6 derivations and elevated cardiac enzymes. Urgent coronary angiography was normal except a 30% narrowing in LAD. She had recurrent nephrolithiasis and had operated because of hydronephrosis. She had two episodes of fatigue and walking disability previously. Hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis with normal anion gap determined in blood gas analyze. Patient diagnosed with type I RTA with the signs and symptoms of recurrent nephrolithiasis, fatigue, severe hypokalemia (1.8 mmol/L), hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis with normal anionic gap, alkaline urine (pH 8) and positive urinary anionic gap (13.7 mmol/L). Sodium bicarbonate infusion and potassium replacement therapy administered. Clinical and laboratory signs of the patient dissolved during treatment. Conclusion: Type 1 RTA should be considered in acidotic patients admitted with hypokalemia and coronary symptoms. Urinary and blood gas analyses should be done beside cardiac tests initially. Therefore, a precise diagnosis may be possible without the possible complications of unnecessary coronary interventions. © 2013 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc. © 2013 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The Women's Health Initiative (WHI) was a large and complex study focused on strategies for the prevention and control of common chronic diseases of postmenopausal women. The WHI included 3 randomized controlled trials: the Hormone Therapy (HT) Trials, the Diet Modification Trial, and the Calcium/Vitamin D (CaD) Trial. Conjugated equine estrogen with or without a progestin significantly decreased hip, clinical vertebral, and all fractures. Once the intervention was stopped, the fracture benefit dissipated. However, estrogen plus progestin was associated with more risks than benefits and use of hormone therapy solely for the prevention of osteoporosis is not recommended. The CaD trial found no overall benefit for fracture reduction except in adherent women and women taking supplements for 5 or more years. Overall, the common practice of taking calcium and vitamin D supplementation with possible benefits on hip and positive evidence on bone mineral density and few risks is reasonable. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York. © 2013 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - This report updates US Public Health Service recommendations for the management of healthcare personnel (HCP) who experience occupational exposure to blood and/or other body fluids that might contain human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Although the principles of exposure management remain unchanged, recommended HIV postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) regimens and the duration of HIV follow-up testing for exposed personnel have been updated. This report emphasizes the importance of primary prevention strategies, the prompt reporting and management of occupational exposures, adherence to recommended HIV PEP regimens when indicated for an exposure, expert consultation in management of exposures, follow-up of exposed HCP to improve adherence to PEP, and careful monitoring for adverse events related to treatment, as well as for virologic, immunologic, and serologic signs of infection. To ensure timely postexposure management and administration of HIV PEP, clinicians should consider occupational exposures as urgent medical concerns, and institutions should take steps to ensure that staff are aware of both the importance of and the institutional mechanisms available for reporting and seeking care for such exposures. The following is a summary of recommendations: (1) PEP is recommended when occupational exposures to HIV occur; (2) the HIV status of the exposure source patient should be determined, if possible, to guide need for HIV PEP; (3) PEP medication regimens should be started as soon as possible after occupational exposure to HIV, and they should be continued for a 4-week duration; (4) new recommendation-PEP medication regimens should contain 3 (or more) antiretroviral drugs (listed in Appendix A) for all occupational exposures to HIV; (5) expert consultation is recommended for any occupational exposures to HIV and at a minimum for situations described in Box 1; (6) close follow-up for exposed personnel (Box 2) should be provided that includes counseling, baseline and follow-up HIV testing, and monitoring for drug toxicity; follow-up appointments should begin within 72 hours of an HIV exposure; and (7) new recommendation-if a newer fourth-generation combination HIV p24 antigen-HIV antibody test is utilized for follow-up HIV testing of exposed HCP, HIV testing may be concluded 4 months after exposure (Box 2); if a newer testing platform is not available, follow-up HIV testing is typically concluded 6 months after an HIV exposure. © 2013 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Objective: To describe use of plain radiography for diagnosis, surgical management, and postoperative treatment of obstructive urolithiasis in small ruminants. Study Design: Retrospective case series. Animals: Small ruminants (n=27; 25 goats, 2 sheep). Methods: Medical records (January 2002-November 2011) and radiographs for all small ruminants diagnosed with obstructive urolithiasis and having plain abdominal radiographs were reviewed. Signalment, surgical procedures, radiographic findings, ultrasonographic findings, position of calculi, and how plain radiography influenced surgical management and postoperative treatment were recorded. Results: Radiopaque urinary calculi were detected in 23 (85%) plain radiographic studies. Location of uroliths determined by plain radiography included: cystic only (n=5), distal to the sigmoid flexure and cystic (5), subischial (5), distal to the sigmoid flexure only (3), sigmoid flexure (3), and subischial and cystic (2). In 8 of these animals, postoperative radiographs revealed residual calculi in the urethra and were essential for their targeted removal by urethrotomy in 7 animals. Conclusions: In regions where radiopaque calculi (calcium carbonate, calcium oxalate, silica) are commonly encountered in small ruminants, plain radiographs are recommended to determine the appropriate surgical approach(es) and to confirm resolution of the obstruction. © 2013 by The American College of Veterinary Surgeons. © 2013 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - In the past five decades or so evidence has been accumulating about an environmental factor, which appears to be influencing mortality, in particular, cardiovascular mortality, and this is the hardness of the drinking water. In addition, several epidemiological investigations have demonstrated the relation between risk for cardiovascular disease, growth retardation, reproductive failure, and other health problems and hardness of drinking water or its content of magnesium and calcium. In addition, the acidity of the water influences the reabsorption of calcium and magnesium in the renal tubule. Not only, calcium and magnesium, but other constituents also affect different health aspects. Thus, the present review attempts to explore the health effects of hard water and its constituents. © 2013 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Constipation is a commonly encountered symptom in school-aged children. The symptoms may vary at presentation and may be complicated by fearful reactions to defecation leading to a stool withholding pattern resulting in encopresis. It is important that a combined approach including education of the patient and family, pharmacological management and behavioral training is utilized for effective treating and prevention of complications. This review summarizes the current evidence and aims to provide practical advice in primary care. © 2013 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Vitamin D is a dietary vitamin that can also be synthesized in adequate amounts from cholesterol in most mammals exposed to sunlight. Vitamin D has classical roles in calcium and phosphate metabolism, and thus the skeleton; however, this molecule also has nonclassical effects that might influence the function of the immune, cardiovascular and endocrine systems. Vitamin D deficiency, due to insufficient sunlight exposure, dietary uptake and/or abnormalities in its metabolism, has been associated with rheumatic diseases, and both the classical and nonclassical effects of vitamin D might be of relevance to patients with rheumatic disease. However, conclusive data from intervention trials demonstrating the relationship between vitamin D levels and pathogenetic processes separate from classical effects of this molecule are lacking. Furthermore, the majority of studies linking vitamin D to health outcomes, harmful or beneficial, are observational in nature, linking clinical events to vitamin D exposure or serum levels of vitamin D metabolites. Evidence from high quality, prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trials should be obtained before vitamin D supplementation is recommended in the treatment of the many rheumatic conditions in which deficiency of this compound has been implicated. Herein, we review the evidence for vitamin D supplementation in the management of patients with rheumatic diseases. © 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

AB  - Although research on neural tissue repair has made enormous progress in recent years, spinal cord injury remains a devastating condition for which there is still no cure. In fact, recent estimates of prevalence in the United States reveal that spinal cord injury has undergone a five-fold increase in the last decades. Though, it has become the second most common neurological problem in North America after Alzheimer's disease. Despite modern trauma units and intensive care treatments, spinal cord injury remains associated with several comorbid conditions and unbearable health care costs. Regular administration of a plethora of symptomatic drug treatments aimed at controlling related-secondary complications and life-threatening problems in chronic spinal cord-injured patients has recently been reported. This article provides a thorough overview of the main drug classes and products currently used or in development for chronic spinal cord injury. Special attention is paid to a novel class of drug treatment designed to provide a holistic solution for several chronic complications and diseases related with spinal cord injury. There is clear evidence showing that new class can elicit 'on-demand' episodes of rhythmic and stereotyped walking activity in previously completely paraplegic animals and may consequently constitute a simple therapy against several physical inactivity-related comorbid problems. Understanding further pharmacological approaches to chronic spinal cord injury may improve both life expectancy and overall quality of life while reducing unsustainable cost increases associated with this debilitation condition. © 2013 Bentham Science Publishers. © 2014 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.; MEDLINE® is the source for the MeSH terms of this document.

AB  - Postkidney transplant hyperparathyroidism is a significant problem. Vitamin D receptor agonists are known to suppress parathyroid hormone (PTH) secretion. We examined the effect of oral paricalcitol on posttransplant secondary hyperparathyroidism by conducting an open label randomized trial in which 100 incident kidney transplant recipients were randomized 1:1 to receive oral paricalcitol, 2 μg per day, for the first year posttransplant or no additional therapy. Serial measurements of serum PTH, calcium and bone alkaline phosphatase, 24-h urine calcium and bone density were performed. The primary endpoint was the frequency of hyperparathyroidism 1-year posttransplant. Eighty-seven patients completed the trial. One-year posttransplant, 29% of paricalcitol-treated subjects had hyperparathyroidism compared with 63% of untreated patients (p = 0.0005). Calcium supplementation was discontinued in two control and 15 treatment patients due to mild hypercalcemia or hypercalcuria. Paricalcitol was discontinued in four patients due to hypercalcuria/ hypercalcemia and in one for preference. Two subjects required decreasing the dose of paricalcitol to 1 μg daily. Hypercalcemia was asymptomatic and reversible. Incidence of acute rejection, BK nephropathy and renal function at 1 year were similar between groups. Moderate renal allograft fibrosis was reduced in treated patients. Oral paricalcitol is effective in decreasing posttransplant hyperparathyroidism and may have beneficial effects on renal allograft histology. Paricalcitol decreases the prevalence of post-kidney transplant hyperparathyroidism and may have beneficial effects on renal allograft histology. © 2013 The American Society of Transplantation and the American Society of Transplant Surgeons. © 2013 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.; MEDLINE® is the source for the MeSH terms of this document.

AB  - Background: Urolithiasis is a metabolic disease of ruminants castrated and uncastrated. The formation of uroliths causes trauma and obstruction in the tract urinary. The nutrition and management are the main predisposing factors for this disease. Many cases occur sporadically, but outbreaks can occur or become an endemic problem. This paper describes a case of obstructive urolithiasis in Nelore cattle uncastrated in Recôncavo of Bahia, Brazil. Case: An 4-year-old Nelore cattle, uncastrated male was sent to the Centro de Desenvolvimento da Pecuária da Universidade Federal da Bahia (CPD-UFBA), Bahia, Brazil. by presenting a swelling on the ventral abdomen 5 days ago. Clinical examination revealed the exposure with mucosal necrosis and hemorrhage preputial, and continuous dripping of urine. The animal was euthanized in extremis and submitted to necropsy. The animal was necropsied and samples collected from the abdominal cavity, thoracic cavity, and nervous system. The samples were fixed in 10% formalin, cleaved, processed routinely for histology, embedded in paraffin, cut at five microns thick and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (HE). Urinary stones collected during necropsy were sent for analysis of chemical composition. The macroscopic had swelling in the ventral abdominal region. By cutting this region was the formation of cavities and filled with red liquid and odor uremic in the subcutaneous. At the opening of the sigmoid flexure of the penile urethra was found urinary calculi with 2 × 1 cm, rough and porous, light brown and rocklike consistency, occluding the urethral light. There was rupture of the urethral mucosa and necrosis of adjacent tissue, plus hemorrhage, and hydronephrosis. Kidney had multiple white areas on the natural surface. In the cut surface of the kidney was observed dilatation of renal calices, some with uroliths. In microscopy of the urethra was observed coagulation necrosis diffuse mucosa and and submucosa with hemorrhage and neutrophilic inflammatory infiltrate. Kidney was observed areas of intense intersticial infiltrate inflammatory, periglomerular fibrosis and peritubular and interstitial collagen deposition. Chemical analysis of uroliths demonstrated the presence of calcium carbonate and calcium oxalate in its composition. Discussion: The diagnosis of obstructive urolithiasis was based from the clinical signs and gross lesions. Works related to obstructive urolithiasis in cattle in Brazil are uncommon. The cases are described more often in small ruminants, usually associated with feed intake unbalanced. In cattle the disease usually occurs in castrated males reared in intensive system. Ventral edema in the perineum, inguinal region, the ventral abdomen and prepuce, are clinical signs that indicate urethral rupture as observed in this case. The pathological changes observed in this case were similar to those described by other authors. In ruminants, the predominant types of uroliths are compounds of struvite, silicates, carbonates and oxalates. The formation of uroliths composed of calcium carbonate associated with the consumption of fodder with a high calcium content and low phosphorus and magnesium. The mechanism of formation of calcium oxalate uroliths is unclear. Unable to determine the factors that have led to the formation of uroliths in this case. © 2013 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Nephrolithiasis is a disease whose prevalence is continuously rising in Western countries. The most common type is idiopathic calcium nephrolithiasis (80%), but gastrointestinal disease, especially inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), may represent a significant risk factor. Nephrolithiasis is indeed a frequent long-term extraintestinal complication of IBD. Dietary habits have a direct effect on urinary lithogenic risk factors and on the onset of kidney stones. The main dietary features that can help preventing and treating nephrolithiasis are high fluid intake, high consumption of fruit and vegetables, low intake of salt and proteins and a balanced amount of calcium, lipids and carbohydrates. In this review we briefly describe epidemiologic and physiopathologic aspects of intestinal disease-associated nephrolithiasis and the role of diet in contrasting onset and relapses of kidney stones. © 2013 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - A 6-yr-old male red kangaroo (Macropus rufus) presented for a history of inappetance, abnormal behavior, and unconfirmed elimination for 6 hr prior to presentation. Based on abdominal ultrasound, abdominocentesis, and cystocentesis, a presumptive diagnosis of urinary tract obstruction with uroabdomen and hydronephrosis was reached. Abdominal radiographs did not assist in reaching an antemortem diagnosis. Postmortem examination confirmed a urinary bladder rupture secondary to urethral obstruction by a single urethrolith. Bilateral hydronephrosis and hydroureter were identified and determined to be a result of bilateral ureteroliths. Urolith analysis revealed a composition of 100% calcium carbonate. A dietary analysis was performed, implicating an increased Ca:P ratio from a food preparation miscommunication as a contributing factor. Appropriate husbandry changes were made, and mob surveillance procedures were performed, which resolved the urolithiasis risk for the remaining five animals.

AB  - This was a case-control study to analyze the associations between calcium urolithiasis and the urokinase polymorphisms, P141L (rs2227564) and 3′-UTR C>T (rs4065), in a Japanese population. Cases consisted of 232 patients with urinary calcium stones (174 men and 58 women) who presented to a general hospital between April 2009 and June 2011. Among these cases, 115 (49.6 %) patients had calcium oxalate stones alone, and 113 (48.7 %) patients had calcium oxalate stones mixed with calcium phosphate stones. Controls consisted of 454 subjects who had a routine health check-up in the same prefecture. The two polymorphisms were genotyped via polymerase chain reaction with confronting two-pair primers. In the control group, the genotype frequencies of P141L were 0.573 for PP, 0.375 for PL, and 0.052 for LL, and those of 3′-UTR C>T were 0.835 for CC, 0.165 for CT, and TT was not identified. Neither of the polymorphisms was significantly associated with urolithiasis. The age- and sex-adjusted odds ratios of urolithiasis were 0.96 [95 % confidence interval (CI), 0.66-1.41] for PL and 1.22 (0.58-2.57) for LL as compared with PP genotype of P141L, and 1.01 (0.62-1.64) for CT as compared with CC genotype of 3′-UTR C>T. When compared with the PP genotype of P141L, the frequency of PL was significantly lower in female cases with a family history of urolithiasis than in females without such family history (p = 0.028). P141L and 3′-UTR polymorphisms of the urokinase gene are not associated with urolithiasis in a Japanese population. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg. © 2013 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.; MEDLINE® is the source for the MeSH terms of this document.

AB  - The Women's Health Initiative (WHI) double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial randomly assigned 36,282 postmenopausal women in the U.S. to 1,000 mg elemental calcium carbonate plus 400 IU of vitamin D<inf>3</inf> daily or placebo, with average intervention period of 7.0 years. The trial was designed to test whether calcium plus vitamin D supplementation in a population in which the use of these supplements was widespread would reduce hip fracture, and secondarily, total fracture and colorectal cancer. Introduction: This study further examines the health benefits and risks of calcium and vitamin D supplementation using WHI data, with emphasis on fractures, cardiovascular disease, cancer, and total mortality. Methods: WHI calcium and vitamin D randomized clinical trial (CT) data through the end of the intervention period were further analyzed with emphasis on treatment effects in relation to duration of supplementation, and these data were contrasted and combined with corresponding data from the WHI prospective observational study (OS). Results: Among women not taking personal calcium or vitamin D supplements at baseline, the hazard ratio [HR] for hip fracture occurrence in the CT following 5 or more years of calcium and vitamin D supplementation versus placebo was 0.62 (95 % confidence interval (CI), 0.38-1.00). In combined analyses of CT and OS data, the corresponding HR was 0.65 (95 % CI, 0.44-0.98). Supplementation effects were not apparent on the risks of myocardial infarction, coronary heart disease, total heart disease, stroke, overall cardiovascular disease, colorectal cancer, or total mortality, while evidence for a reduction in breast cancer risk and total invasive cancer risk among calcium plus vitamin D users was only suggestive. Conclusion: Though based primarily on a subset analysis, long-term use of calcium and vitamin D appears to confer a reduction that may be substantial in the risk of hip fracture among postmenopausal women. Other health benefits and risks of supplementation at doses considered, including an elevation in urinary tract stone formation, appear to be modest and approximately balanced. © 2012 The Author(s). © 2013 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.; MEDLINE® is the source for the MeSH terms of this document.

AB  - Opinion statement: The problem of short-lasting unilateral neuralgiform headache attacks with conjunctival injection and tearing (SUNCT) and short-lasting unilateral neuralgiform headache attacks with cranial autonomic symptoms (SUNA) management remains unsolved. Despite a myriad of therapeutic trials, no convincingly effective remedy for SUNCT and SUNA is available at present. Based on open-label communications, some patients seemed to benefit from some pharmacologic, interventional, or invasive procedures. Possible effective preventive drugs are carbamazepine, lamotrigine, gabapentin, and topiramate. At present, the drug of choice for SUNCT seems to be lamotrigine whereas SUNA may better respond to gabapentin. There is no available abortive treatment for the individual attacks. During the worst periods, intravenous lidocaine may decrease the flow of SUNCT/SUNA attacks. In SUNCT, bilateral blockade of the greater occipital nerve, and superior cervical ganglion opioid blockade have been reported as temporary/partially effective in one patient each. Botulinum toxin injected around the symptomatic orbit provided sustained relief to one patient. Owing to the scarcity of reports the results of these interventions should be taken as preliminary. Invasive therapy with interventions directed to the first division of the trigeminal nerve or Gasserian ganglion, with local anesthetics or alcohol, radiofrequency thermocoagulation, microvascular decompression, and gamma-knife neurosurgery, have been tried in the treatment of refractory SUNCT. Some patients seemed to benefit from such interventions, but one should still have a critical attitude to these claims since no convincing results have been obtained as yet. The few SUNCT patients who underwent deep brain hypothalamic stimulation obtained a substantial and persistent relief. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media New York. © 2013 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - This article reviews the data on pharmacologic treatment of kidney stone disease, with a focus on prophylaxis against stone recurrence. One of the most effective and important therapies for stone prevention, an increase in urine volume, is not discussed because this is a dietary and not a pharmacologic intervention. Also reviewed are medical expulsive therapy used to improve the spontaneous passage of ureteral stones and pharmacologic treatment of symptoms associated with ureteral stents. The goal is to review the literature with a focus on the highest level of evidence (ie, randomized controlled trials). © 2013 Elsevier Inc. © 2013 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.; MEDLINE® is the source for the MeSH terms of this document.

AB  - Silicate urinary calculi are rare in humans, with an incidence of 0.2% of all urinary calculi. Most cases were related to excess ingestion of silicate, typically by taking magnesium trisilicate as an antacid for peptic ulcers over a long period of time; however, there also existed unrelated cases, whose mechanism of development remains unclear. On the other hand, zonisamide, a newer antiepileptic drug, is one of the important causing agents of iatrogenic urinary stones in patients with epilepsy. The supposed mechanism is that zonisamide induces urine alkalinization and then promotes crystallization of urine components such as calcium phosphate by inhibition of carbonate dehydratase in renal tubular epithelial cells. Here, we report a case of silicate urolithiasis during long-term treatment with zonisamide without magnesium trisilicate intake and discuss the etiology of the disease by examining the silicate concentration in his urine. © 2013 Satoru Taguchi et al. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - A 62-year-old healthy woman presents for routine care. She has no history of fracture, but she is worried about osteoporosis because her mother had a hip fracture at 72 years of age. She exercises regularly and has taken over-the-counter calcium carbonate at a dose of 1000 mg three times a day since her menopause at 54 years of age. This regimen provides 1200 mg of elemental calcium per day. She eats a healthy diet with multiple servings of fruits and vegetables and consumes one 8-oz serving of low-fat yogurt and one glass of low-fat milk almost every day. She recently heard that calcium supplements could increase her risk of cardiovascular disease and wants your opinion about whether or not she should receive them. What would you advise?

AB  - Purpose:In this paper we present our experience with dissolution therapy of radiolucent calculi. Materials and Methods: This was a retrospective analysis of patients who were offered urinary dissolution therapy between January 2010 and June 2011. Patients were treated with tablets containing potassium citrate and magnesium oxide. Partial dissolutionwas defined as at least a 50% reduction in stone size. Patients with complete or partial dissolution were classified in the successful dissolution group. Patients with no change,inadequate reduction, increase in stone size and those unable to tolerate alkali therapy were classified as failures. Patient sex, stenting before alkalinization, stone size, urine pH at presentation and serum uric acid levels were analyzed using Fisher t-test foran association with successful dissolution. Results: Out of 67, 48 patients reported for follow up. 10 (15%) had complete dissolution and 13 (19%) had partial dissolution. Alkalinization was unsuccessful in achieving dissolution in 25 (37%). Stenting before alkalinization, patient weight (< 60 vs. > 75kg) and serum uric acid levels (= 6 vs. > 6) were theonly factors to significantly affected dissolution rates (p = 0.039, p 0.035, p 0.01 respectively). Conclusions: A policy of offering dissolution therapy to patients with radiolucent calculi had a successful outcome in 34% of patients. © 2014 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.; MEDLINE® is the source for the MeSH terms of this document.

AB  - Guinea pigs (Cavia porcelles) are susceptible to formation of urinary tract calculi. Uroliths can be located anywhere in the urinary tract and are typically composed of calcium salts. A pet, female guinea pig, aged 5 years and weighing 0.5 kg was referred to Internal Medicine Department Clinics for stranguria and recurrent haematuria over 15 days. The guinea pig was emaciated, dehydrated and hypothermic, also demonstrated pain on caudal abdominal palpation and a small thickened bladder wall was discovered. Gastric dilatation and urinary calculus was detected with thoracoabdominal radiography. 2 days later death was learned and then it was brought for necropsy to Department of Pathology. Necropsy revealed calculus in the lumen of urinary bladder with the dimensions of 0.7x0.5 cm though no distinct changes were grossly evident in the urinary tract. The bladder was empty and the mucosa was moderately thickened suggestive of fibrosis and edema resulting from a possible chronic condition. Physical and chemical analysis of the calculus was done by laboratory. Calcium and oxalates are the main risk factors for stone formation, but the calculus of this guinea pig included calcium carbonate and oxalate in combination with other minerals; including struvite. To the authors' knowledge, it was the first guinea pig including urinary signs and calculus, presented in Turkey. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Objectives: This paper aims to examine the risk of nephrolithiasis in patients with osteoporosis and calcium supplementation. Methods: This work is based on the systematic review of studies retrieved by a sensitive search strategy in Medline and Embase (1991-2010), and the Cochrane Central register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) up to 2010. The abstracts of the annual scientific meetings of the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) and the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) (2008-2010) were also examined. The selection criteria were the following: patients with osteoporosis, on calcium supplementation alone or associated with other treatments for osteoporosis. We measured the likelihood of developing kidney stones, renal colic, changes in urinary sediment and serum parameters. We selected systematic literature reviews, randomised clinical trials (RCT) and cohort studies. Results: We included 10 studies, 8 RCT and 2 cohort studies of moderate quality. All patients had osteoporosis (>8.000 patients), they were mostly women with a mean age of 50-70 years. Daily calcium doses varied from 120 mg up to 1.500 mg, and treatment duration from 3 days to 3 years. Changes in urinary sediment were found, but in general they were not clinically relevant. No cases of nephrolitiasis were found in more than a half of the included studies. In total there were 3 cases of kidney stone, 2 urinary tract calcifications, 16 cases of nephrolithiasis or urolithiasis, 4 of haematuria and 5 patients reporting kidney pain. Conclusion. According to our results, calcium supplements in the treatment of osteoporosis alone or in combination with another type of treatment does not significantly increase the risk of nephrolithiasis or renal colic. © Clinical And Experimental Rheumatology 2012. © 2014 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.; MEDLINE® is the source for the MeSH terms of this document.

AB  - Introduction: Individual X-Ray diffraction patterns of biological tissues are obtained via interference of coherent scattering with their electrons. Many scientists have distinguished normal and cancerous breast tissue, bone density, and urinary stone types using the X-Ray diffraction patterns resulting from coherent scattering. The goal of this study was to introduce an optimized method for obtaining X-ray diffraction patterns of different types from biological tissues. Materials and Methods: A special tool constituting primary and scatter collimators as well as a sample holder was designed and built. All measurements were done using an X-ray tube,the above-mentioned tool, and a semiconductor detector (HPGe). The X-ray diffraction patterns of some tissue-equivalent materials (acrylic, polyethylene, nylon, and calcium carbonate) and biological tissues (adipose, muscle, and bone) were obtained.Results: The corresponding peak positions for adipose, muscle, bone, acrylic, polyethylene, nylon, and calcium carbonate in corresponding X-ray diffraction patterns are located in 1.1±0.055 nm-1, 1.41±0.072, 1.6±0.08 nm-1, 0.8±0.04 nm-1, 1.03±0.051 nm-1, 1.22±0.061 nm-1, and 1.7 ± 0.085 nm-1, respectively. Conclusion: The X-ray diffraction patterns obtained in this study were in good agreement relative to previous measurements in terms of peak position. This study introduces a useful setup for extraction of X-ray diffraction patterns from different biological tissues. © 2012 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To develop a practical, readily applied algorithm for primary health care providers to identify, evaluate, and manage constipation in children with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). METHODS: The Gastroenterology Committee of the Autism Speaks Autism Treatment Network (ATN), a multisite consortium of centers dedicated to improving standards of medical care for children with ASDs, guided the development of the constipation algorithm through expert opinion and literature review. The algorithm was finalized based on results of field testing by nongastrointestinal, ATN autism medical specialists at 4 ATN sites. A systematic review and grading of the literature pertaining to constipation and children with ASDs was also performed. RESULTS: Consensus among the ATN Gastroenterology Committee identified that in children with ASDs, (1) subtle or atypical symptoms might indicate the presence of constipation; (2) screening, identification, and treatment through a deliberate approach for underlying causes of constipation is appropriate; (3) diagnostic-therapeutic intervention can be provided when constipation is documented; and (4) careful follow-up after any intervention be performed to evaluate effectiveness and tolerance of the therapy. Literature review revealed limited evidence for the clinical evaluation or treatment strategies of children with ASD and constipation. CONCLUSIONS: Constipation and its underlying etiology have the potential to be effectively identified and managed using a systematic approach. Lack of evidence on this topic in the literature emphasizes the need for research.

AB  - Cystinuria is a relatively uncommon cause of pediatric stone disease, but has significant morbidity if not properly controlled because of its significant stone recurrence rate. Cystinuria is caused by the inability of the renal tubules to reabsorb filtered cystine, which is poorly soluble at a typical urine pH <7. Although many advances have been made in the understanding of the genetic and physiological basis of cystinuria, the cornerstones of treatment still involve stone prevention with dietary measures and pharmacological therapy, coupled with surgical interventions for stone removal. Pharmacological treatments can carry significant side effects that must be monitored and can limit therapy as well as impede compliance. Most patients will require surgical intervention for stone removal, although compliance with prevention strategies reduces the need for intervention. © 2012 IPNA. © 2013 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.; MEDLINE® is the source for the MeSH terms of this document.

AB  - Background: Renal stones are one of the most common disorders of the urinary tract. They are solid mass made up of crystals. Renal stones can form when the urine becomes so saturated with a certain minerals. These minerals can create crystals that become stones. The aims of the study were to identify the most common risk factors which may cause urinary calculi and to find out if there is a significant relation between those factors and other variables such as the sex. Method and material: One hundred patients whom diagnosed with renal stone were chosen after several investigations such as urine analysis Ultrasonography and X-ray for kidneys ureters and bladder (K.U.B). An Interview technique was used as a method for gathering data, the researcher and her assistants completed the questionnaires. Results: The results showed that male patients constituted (68%) of the sample and female (32%), in addition there was a statistical difference between the mean and standard deviation for male and female patients. This study also showed that (44%) of the patients whose relative have been afflicted with urinary calculi in comparison with control group are (18%). This study indicated that (33%) of patients had dehydration due to decrease fluid intake and sweating, while (14%) of control group had the same condition. Result showed that (9) out of (20) items were statistically significant, (p<0.01).This means that there were significant relations between renal stones formation and risk factors such as (Gout, dehydration, Bilharziasis, genetics factors, bed rest, urinary catheter, taking antacids tablets and vegetables). Conclusions: The researcher recommends that increase hydration and drinking a large amount of water is probability the most important step in reducing renal stone In addition, avoid taking too much vegetables and drugs that cause renal stones e.g. antacids and aspirin, moreover, dietary adjustments help in preventing the development and the recurrence of the stones. © 2012 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: The charity 'Health Partnership Nepal' is committed to both improving global health care and providing medical training links between Nepal and the UK. This paper analyses data gathered at rural health camps. Aim: To describe the demographics, diagnoses and treatments offered to people attending three rural health camps in Nepal during 2009. Design: Cross-sectional study. Setting: Three free health care camps established within the Nuwakot district of Nepal during April-May 2009. Camps were staffed by doctors including GPs, nurses and medical students from London and Kathmandu. Methods: Attendees had treatment sheets completed which recorded their demographics, diagnoses and dispensed medications. Results: The mean age of the 1903 consecutive patients attending was 42.8 years (range one month to 98 years) of whom 68.6% were female and 13.7% were children. The majority, 82.3%, were agricultural workers. For adults (n = 1574), the most frequent complaints were stomach pain 20.1%, musculoskeletal pain 19.3% and visual acuity problems 6.1%. Stomach pain was significantly more common in women than men [21.2% (236/1064) versus 14.5% (65/449) P < 0.01]. For children (n = 249), the most common diagnoses were helminthiasis 10.4%, conjunctivitis 7.6% and upper respiratory tract infection 7.2%. Overall, opthalmological, gastroenterological and rheumatological diagnoses were significantly more common in Nepalese than UK general practice patients. Of 1109 recorded prescriptions, the most common were multivitamins 23%, oral analgesics 15% and oral antibiotics 14%. Conclusions: There is a considerable unmet disease burden within rural districts of Nepal particularly for stomach pain, musculoskeletal pain and visual acuity problems. When planning similar rurally based health camps, we recommend recruiting GPs and ophthalmologists. © The Author 2012. Published by Oxford University Press.

AB  - Background.Lossofbonemineraldensityisanunintended consequence of androgen deprivation therapy in men with prostate cancer. Supplementation with calcium and/or vitamin D in these men seems logical and is advocated by many lay and professional groups. Methods. We reviewed guidelines for calcium and vitamin D supplementation and the results of clinical trials of calcium and vitamin D supplementation on bone mineral density in men with prostate cancer undergoing androgen deprivation therapy. Results. Whether supplementation of men undergoing androgen deprivation therapy with calcium and/or vitamin D results in higher bone mineral density than no supplementation has not been tested. The results of 12 clinical trials show that, at the doses commonly recommended, 500-1,000 mg calcium and 200-500 IU vitamin D per day, men undergoing androgen deprivation lose bone mineral density. Conclusion. The doses of calcium and vitamin D that have been tested are inadequate to prevent loss of bone mineral density in men undergoing androgen deprivation therapy. In light of evidence that high levels of dietary calcium and calcium supplement use are associated with higher risks for cardiovascular disease and advanced prostate cancer, intervention studies should evaluate the safety as well as the efficacy of calcium and vitamin D supplementation in these men. © AlphaMed Press. © 2013 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.; MEDLINE® is the source for the MeSH terms of this document.

AB  - The synthesis of calcium carbonate (CaCO <inf>3</inf>) crystals in the presence of bacteria Escherichia coliform (E. coli) was investigated. The products were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and X-ray powder diffractometry. The results showed that calcite spherical superstructures constructed from small rhombohedral building units were formed with bacteria, and the particles are much larger than those formed without bacteria. The formation mechanism of CaCO <inf>3</inf> crystals in the presence of E. coli is explored, suggesting that the bacterial biomolecules especially proteins may induce the nucleation, growth, and aggregation of CaCO <inf>3</inf> crystals. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC. © 2012 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Objective: To report use of transendoscopic electrohydraulic shockwave lithotripsy for fragmentation of urinary calculi in horses. Study Design: Case series. Animals: Male horses (n = 21). Methods: Fragmentation of cystic calculi (median, 6 cm diameter; range, 4-11 cm diameter) was achieved by transurethral endoscopy in standing sedated horses using an electrohydraulic shockwave fiber introduced through the biopsy channel of an endoscope. The fiber was advanced until it contacted the calculus. Repeated activation of the fiber was used to disrupt the calculus into fragments <1 cm diameter. Visibility within the bladder was maintained by repeated lavage with saline solution. Results: Complete calculus removal was achieved in 20 horses (95%) with mean total surgical time of 168.6 minutes (range, 45-450). In the 20 horses with single calculi, 1-6 sessions were required to completely fragment the calculus. Except for 1 horse, in which perineal urethrotomy was eventually performed for complete fragment removal, fragments calculi were excreted via the urethra. Postoperative complications included hematuria because of severe mucosal erosion (n = 2), dysuria because of a trapped urethral fragment (2), small amount of urinary debris (1). One horse was euthanatized because of bladder rupture. Complete clearance of calculi and urinary debris was confirmed endoscopically 20 (3-45) days after the last session. Telephone follow-up (mean, 18.8 months; range, 7-24 months) revealed that horses had returned to previous activity levels without recurrence of clinical signs. Conclusions: Transendoscopic electrohydraulic lithotripsy appears to be an effective method for fragmentation of low-density calcium carbonate cystic calculi in male horses. © 2012 by The American College of Veterinary Surgeons. © 2013 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.; MEDLINE® is the source for the MeSH terms of this document.

AB  - Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) has been carried out to analyze the organic and inorganic constituent of human urinary stones. Patient's hailing from Rajah Muthiah Medical College and Hospital, Annamalai University, Tamil Nadu, India was selected for the study. The FT-IR results indicate that stones have different composition, i.e., namely calcium oxalate, calcium phosphate, carbonate apatite and magnesium ammonium phosphate and uric acid. From the spectral and powder X-ray diffraction pattern, the chemical constituents of urinary stones were identified. The quantitative estimations of calcium oxalate monohydrate (COM) 1620 cm -1, calcium phosphate (apatite) 1037 cm -1, magnesium ammonium phosphate (struvite) 1010 cm -1, calcium carbonate 1460 cm -1 and uric acid 1441 cm -1 were calculated using particular peaks of FT-IR studies. The study reveals that calcium oxalate monohydrate and calcium phosphate type urinary stones were predominant whereas magnesium ammonium phosphate are in moderate level, and calcium carbonate and uric acid are in low. Calcium phosphate is found in all the stones and calcium oxalate monohydrate is found to be higher. Quantitative analyses of urinary stones show that calcium oxalate monohydrate (40%), apatite (30%), magnesium ammonium phosphate (23%) and uric acid (7%) are present in all the urinary stone samples. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Context: The pathogenetic mechanisms of kidney stone formation are complex and involve both metabolic and environmental risk factors. Over the past decade, major advances have been made in the understanding of the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of kidney stone disease. Evidence Acquisition and Synthesis: Both original and review articles were found via PubMed search reporting on pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management of kidney stones. These resources were integrated with the authors' knowledge of the field. Conclusion: Nephrolithiasis remains a major economic and health burden worldwide. Nephrolithiasis is considered a systemic disorder associated with chronic kidney disease, bone loss and fractures, increased risk of coronary artery disease, hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and the metabolic syndrome. Further understanding of the pathophysiological link between nephrolithiasis and these systemic disorders is necessary for the development of new therapeutic options.

AB  - Context: Hematological manifestations are less known in primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT). Anemia has been recognized as a complication of PHPT in 5-30% of the individuals in various series. Objective: Our objective was to identify hematological improvement after the curative parathyroidectomy in a PHPT patient with anemia and thrombocytopenia. Patient and Methods: A 30-yr-old female presented with recurrent renal stone disease, anemia, and thrombocytopenia diagnosed as PHPT. Bone marrow examination revealed megakaryocytic thrombocytopenia. Two months after the curative parathyroidectomy, her symptoms and hematological parameters were improved. Conclusion: Our finding showed a causal association of both anemia and thrombocytopenia with marrow fibrosis in a symptomatic PHPT patient because both anemia and thrombocytopenia improved after the curative parathyroidectomy.

AB  - Background. Older individuals represent a substantial proportion of international travelers. Because of physiological changes and the increased probability of underlying medical conditions, older travelers might be at higher risk for at least some travel-associated diseases. Methods. With the aim of describing the epidemiology of travel-associated diseases in older adults, medical data were prospectively collected on ill international travelers presenting to GeoSentinel sites from 1997 to 2009. Seven thousand thirty-four patients aged 60 years and over were identified as older travelers and were compared to 56,042 patients aged 18-45 years, who were used as the young adult reference population. Results. The proportionate morbidity of several etiological diagnoses was higher in older ill travelers compared to younger ill, including notably lower respiratory tract infections, high-altitude pulmonary edema, phlebitis and pulmonary embolism, arthropod bites, severe malaria, rickettsiosis, gastritis, peptic ulcers, esophagitis and gastroesophageal reflux disease, trauma and injuries, urinary tract infections, heart disease, and death. In contrast, acute diarrhea, upper respiratory tract infections, flu and flu-like illnesses, malaria, dengue, genital infections, sexually transmitted diseases, and schistosomiasis proportionate morbidities were lower among the older group. Conclusion. Older ill travelers are more likely to suffer from certain life-threatening diseases and would benefit from reinforcement of specific preventive measures including use of anti-thrombosis compression stockings and sufficient hydration and exercises during long-distance flights, hand hygiene, use of disposable handkerchiefs, consideration of face-masks in crowded conditions, influenza and pneumococcal vaccines, progressive acclimatization to altitude, consideration of acetazolamide, and use of repellents and mosquito nets. Antibiotics for the presumptive treatment of respiratory and urinary tract infections may be considered, as well as antacid medications. At-risk patients should be referred to a specialist for medical evaluation before departing, and optimal control of co-morbidities such as cardiovascular and chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases should be achieved, particularly for high-altitude travel. © 2012 International Society of Travel Medicine. © 2012 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.; MEDLINE® is the source for the MeSH terms of this document.

AB  - Objectives: The analysis of urinary stones is used for the diagnosis of the etiology of an episode of nephrolithiasis. The technique considered as standard for this purpose is infrared spectroscopy (IR). However, when the urinary stone is formed by a mixture of components, only semi-quantitative information can be achieved using IR. The objective of this work is the development of a quantitative method. Design and methods: Bands in the IR spectra of several mixtures were studied, in order to design a calibration model useful to determine the quantitative composition of the urinary stones. For mixtures of two components, four mathematical models were proposed. To assess the validity of these models, nine series of mixtures of two components were prepared, using the most frequently compounds found in urinary stones, for analyzing by ATR-FTIR spectroscopy (Attenuated Total Reflection Fourier Transformed Infrared). Results: Nine series of nine mixtures of two components were prepared for this work. The IR spectrum was recorded for each mixture and the absorbance intensities at selected wave numbers were used to apply the proposed mathematical models. There were good linear correlations between the analytical signals (IR absorbances) and the analytical responses (weight fractions) using the calibration lines. The validity of the method was checked by the comparison between the weight fractions resulted from the calibration lines and the real weight fractions obtained by weighing, presenting good correlation parameters. Conclusions: The method developed in this work has been useful for the quantification of compounds which are commonly found in urinary stones. This method allows a total characterization of the urinary stones (qualitative and quantitative) by means of IR spectroscopy. © 2012 Elsevier Inc. © 2012 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.; MEDLINE® is the source for the MeSH terms of this document.

AB  - Malakoplakia is a protean systemic chronic granulomatous disease that usually targets the genito-urinary system and most particularly the bladder. Only in rare occasions do the kidneys get involved. Myelodysplastic syndrome is a heterogeneous clonal haematopoietic disorder characterised by either a hyper- or hypocellular bone marrow dysmyelopoiesis and peripheral blood pancytopenia. The synchronous association of these two unrelated disorders has never been reported. We report a 62-year-old woman who initially developed vague, relapsing gastrointestinal symptoms synchronous with renal malakoplakia and myelodysplastic syndrome. © 2012 The Authors.

AB  - Objective: Bacterial imprints are always observed on highly carbonated apatite kidney stones but not struvite kidney stones. Struvite and carbonated apatite stones with a high CO <inf>3</inf> 2/PO <inf>4</inf> 3 rate are believed to develop from infections, but their structural differences at the mesoscopic scale lack explanation. Methods: We investigated 17 urinary calculi composed mainly of struvite or carbonated apatite by Fourier transform infrared, scanning electron microscopy, and powder neutron diffraction techniques. Results: Carbonated apatite but not struvite stones showed bacterial imprints. If the same stone contained both carbonated apatite and struvite components, bacterial imprints were observed on the carbonated apatite but not the struvite part. Moreover, neutron powder diffraction experiments revealed the crystal size of struvite stones were larger than that of carbonated apatite stones (250 ± 50 vs 50 nm). Conclusion: Bacterial imprints may appear more easily on kidney stones with small nanocrystals, such as carbonated apatite than with large nanocrystals, such as struvite. This approach may help identify bacteria contributing to stone formation, perhaps with negative results of urine culture. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Case Description-A 5-year-old 2.23-kg (4.91-lb) spayed female Lop rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) was evaluated because of a history of lethargy, polyuria, and polydipsia of 1 month's duration. The referring veterinarian made a presumptive diagnosis of hypercalcemia of unknown etiology on the basis of a plasma total calcium concentration of 14.0 mg/dL. Clinical Findings-Physical examination findings were unremarkable. Hematologic and plasma biochemical analysis revealed nonregenerative, normocytic, normochromic anemia (PCV, 28%) with heteropenia (23%; 1,334 heterophils/mL) and a total plasma calcium concentration of 16 mg/dL. Radiographic and ultrasonographic examination revealed radiodense and hyperechoic structures in both renal pelves and right unilateral nephrolithiasis. Treatment and Outcome-Nephrotomy was performed via laparotomy with a right lateral approach. A nephrolith composed of calcium carbonate and carbonate apatite was removed from the right renal pelvis. The rabbit's plasma tested positive for antibodies against Encephalitozoon cuniculi by means of an indirect immunofluorescence assay, and fenbendazole (20 mg/kg [9.1 mg/lb], PO, q 24 h) was administered for 28 days. Although plasma calcium concentration was not substantially decreased after treatment (values were 14.1 and 15.1 mg/dL 1 week and 3 months after surgery, respectively), the patient did not have clinical signs of hypercalcemia and died of unrelated causes approximately 1 year after surgery. Clinical Relevance-To the authors' knowledge, this is the first report of a nephrotomy performed in a rabbit via a lateral abdominal approach. This approach allowed easy location of the kidney and also reduced manipulation, thus decreasing the risk of damaging the abdominal viscera and potentially decreasing postoperative pain. © 2012 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.; MEDLINE® is the source for the MeSH terms of this document.

AB  - Pediatric urolithiasis is more common than previously reported. All children with urolithiasis deserve a thorough evaluation after their initial presentation. With careful assessment, metabolic risk factors may be found in the majority of children, leading to appropriate medical therapy of modifiable risk factors and prevention of further stone formation. Furthermore, early identification of inborn errors of metabolism is important to prevent morbidities associated with these disorders, such as end-stage renal disease. This review discusses the etiologies of pediatric urolithiasis, the metabolic evaluation, and treatment options. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC. © 2012 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - A nationwide statistical survey of 4196 dialysis facilities was conducted at the end of 2009, and 4133 facilities (98.5%) responded. The number of patients undergoing dialysis at the end of 2009 was determined to be 290661, an increase of 7240 patients (2.6%) compared with that of 2008. The number of dialysis patients per million at the end of 2009 was 2279.5. The crude death rate of dialysis patients from the end of 2008 to the end of 2009 was 9.6%. The mean age of the new patients introduced into dialysis was 67.3years old and the mean age of the entire dialysis patient population was 65.8years old. Primary diseases such as diabetic nephropathy and chronic glomerulonephritis for new dialysis patients, showed a percentage of 44.5% and 21.9%, respectively. Based on the facilities surveyed, 84.2% of the facilities that responded to the questionnaire satisfied the microbiological quality standard for dialysis fluids for the Japanese Society for Dialysis Therapy (JSDT), with an endotoxin concentration of less than 0.05EU/mL in the dialysis fluid. Similarly, 98.2% of the facilities surveyed satisfied another standard of the society of a bacterial count of less than 100cfu/mL in the dialysis fluid. The facility survey indicated that the number of patients who were treated by blood purification by both peritoneal dialysis and extracorporeal circulation, such as hemodialysis, was 1720. Among the total number of patients, 24.8% were satisfied with the management target recommended in the treatment guidelines for secondary hyperparathyroidism. These standards are set by the JSDT, based on the three parameters, i.e. serum calcium concentration, serum phosphorus concentration, and serum intact parathyroid hormone concentration. According to the questionnaire, 9.8% of the patients were considered to have a complication of dementia. © 2012 The Authors.

AB  - The dissolution of urinary stones could be performed in the patients with urinary obstruction caused by phosphate, or uric acid stones, through the percutaneous nephrostomy (PCN). A 27-year-old woman with complete obstruction of the solitary left kidney due to uric acid stones is presented. The woman was admitted in emergency unit due to anuria. Five days after PCN, irrigation with 1.6% sodium bicarbonate solution was initiated. Due to complete ureteral obstruction, the "Y" extension with the valve was connected to PCN and to the urinary bag, which enabled the patient to perform intermittent self-irrigation. After 12 days of irrigation, all the stones dissolute and ceased. In the era of ESWL, PCNL and ureterorenoscopy, PCN-dissolution of urinary stones is rare procedure. However, this minimally invasive procedure could be successfully performed in selected cases. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Constipation, defined as a delay or difficulty in defecation, present for 2 or more weeks, is a common pediatric problem encountered by practitioners. Most childhood constipation results from intentional withholding of stool following a painful experience with defecation, Constipation and encopresis typically are categorized as functional GI disorders. As discussed in detail later, increasing evidence suggests that dietary,lifestyle, cognitive, emotional/behavioral, and broader psychosocial factors may all play a role in the etiology, maintenance, and clinically effective treatment of functional GI disorders. Because of the multifactorial nature of constipation, a holistic approach to its assessment and treatment , treatment should include education, evacuation of the rectum with oral or rectal laxatives if an impaction is present, laxatives to ensure soft stools and behavior modification. © 2012 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Atazanavir (ATV) is an HIV protease inhibitor (PI) that was approved as antiretroviral agent in year 2003. Ritonavir (RTV) enhances ATV plasma exposure and increases its barrier to resistance. Antiretroviral therapy with ATV plus RTV (ATV/r) has demonstrated high potency for achieving virological suppression in antiretroviral-naïve patients and in simplification strategies. In rescue interventions, ATV/r-based combinations have shown to be equivalent in terms of viral response to other PI/r-containing regimens. In contrast with all other PIs, ATV has also demonstrated efficacy when given unboosted with RTV, an option attractive in special situations. Other benefits of the drug are its good metabolic and gastrointestinal profile. Its main adverse event is hyperbilirubinemia, since ATV inhibits the hepatic uridin-glucoronyl-transferase. A signature mutation at the protease gene, I50L, confers loss of susceptibility to the drug whereas it may confer hypersusceptibility to other PIs. Many ATV studies have provided data until or beyond week 96, supporting the efficacy and safety of the drug in the long-term. © the author(s), publisher and licensee Libertas Academica Ltd. © 2014 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Struvite stones, also known as infection stones, have a chemical composition of magnesium ammonium phosphate, with or without calcium carbonate. They are named "infection stones" due to their association with urea-splitting bacteria, which degrade urea into ammonium and carbon dioxide, thus providing a major substrate for the development of a large, branched renal calculus. The most important urease producers include Proteus, Pseudomonas, Klebsiella, and Staphylococcus species. Moreover, bacterial endotoxins produced by many of these organisms contribute to the formation of a biofilm, which can entrap cations and promote crystallization. Staghorn calculi have been known to grow rapidly, in some instances as quick as 4-6 weeks. In addition to urea breakdown, urinary stasis may also contribute to calculus formation as seen in patients with urinary diversion, ureteropelvic junction (UPJ) obstruction, bladder outlet obstruction, or neurogenic voiding dysfunction. The management of infection stones includes antibiotic administration and complete stone removal. Retained fragments have a propensity to be associated with regrowth of renal stones in the vast majority of patients, demonstrating the necessity for an aggressive therapeutic approach. © 2011 Springer-Verlag London Limited. © 2014 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Urethral calculi are rare and usually encountered in males with urethral pathology. Objective: To present our experience managing urethral calculi in a resource limited centre and review the literature. Methods: We did a chart review of management of patients with urethral calculi between January and April 2009, at Federal Medical Centre (FMC) Azare, Nigeria. We also reviewed the literature on this rare condition. Results: Four young adult male Nigerians between the ages of 17 and 27 years presented with varying degrees of urethral pain and palpable calculi in the anterior urethra. Two presented with acute retention of urine, but none had haematuria. The calculi were radio-opaque, located in the anterior urethra with no associated urethral pathology. Three were solitary and one multiple. The composition of the urethral calculi was a mixture of calcium oxalate calcium carbonate, magnesium phosphate, one has additional cystine but none had struvite or uric acid. Their sizes ranged between 1cm x1.5cm and 1.5cm x 5.5cm. External urethrotomy was the method of treatment. Conclusion: Urethral calculi are rare in our setting, with no clear identifiable aetiological factors which suggests urinary schistosomiasisbeing associsted. The occurrence of urethral calculi appears to have a relationship with childhood urinary schistosomasis. © 2014 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Enteric hyperoxaluria causes tubular deposition of calcium oxalate crystals and severe chronic interstitial nephritis. We describe a patient with pre-terminal renal failure due to oxalate nephropathy after ileal resection. Increased oral hydration, low oxalate diet, and oral calcium carbonate and potassium citrate supplements resulted in a significant improvement of renal function. During the three-year follow-up, urinary oxalate concentration was repeatedly reduced below the crystallization threshold and serum creatinine decreased from 4.5 to 1.7 mg/dL. This case illustrates the benefit of combining and optimizing dietary and medical management in enteric hyperoxaluria, even in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease. © 2012 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.; MEDLINE® is the source for the MeSH terms of this document.

AB  - Drug-induced calculi and other rare stone types, such as ammonium acid urate or protein matrix stones, represent only about 2% of all renal calculi. However, the chance to easily reverse stone formation risk by discontinuing the offending drug makes identification of these entities important for clinicians. Additionally, study of these rare stone types contributes to understanding the biochemistry of stone formation. Drug-induced calculi may be classified into two groups based on the mechanism of stone formation. The first group includes drugs that provoke calculi composed of principally the drug and its metabolites. These medications tend to be poorly soluble, highly excreted in urine, and required at high dosages for long durations of therapy. Historically, sulfonamides, triamterene, and the HIV protease inhibitor indinavir were leading causes of drug-induced calculi. Uses of novel agents within these drug classes or alternative therapies have reduced the incidence attributed to these drugs, although risk from newer, commonly used medications-notably ciprofloxacin, aminopenicillins, ceftriaxone, ephedrine, and guaifenesinare increasingly being recognized. Microscopic analysis for crystalluria or infrared spectroscopy of collected stones aid in recognition of calculi composed primarily of a drug and its metabolites. Understanding of drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics, particularly related to effects of urine pH on drug solubility and excretion, provides a rational basis for both prevention and treatment recommendations. When possible, clinicians should avoid or exercise great caution when prescribing these medications to patients with a prior history of stones. The second group of drug-induced calculi includes drugs that cause stones due to their metabolic effects, primarily on calcium or purine metabolism. Because these calculi are identical in physical composition to the more common nephrolithiasis types, careful medication history and high clinical suspicion are required for diagnosis of these drug-induced "metabolic" calculi. Most drugs in this class are readily expected based on their effects on urinary calcium excretion such as calcium/Vitamin D supplements and loop diuretics. Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, including the antiepileptics topiramate and zonisamide, are also included in this group. Ammonium acid urate stones are endemic in developing countries due to dietary limitations and recurrent diarrheal illness, but rarely occur in developed countries. Identification of these stones should raise clinical suspicion of epidemiologic risk factors including recurrent urinary tract infections with urea-splitting organisms, inflammatory bowel disease, and laxative abuse. Interestingly, these unusual clinical scenarios can recapitulate a common biochemical pathway to stone formation. Protein matrix stones are another unusual stone type associated with specific epidemiologic factors, namely recurrent urinary infections and proteinuric end-stage renal disease. Although distinctly rare, protein matrix stones provide opportunity to investigate basic biochemical mechanisms underlying stone formation. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2011. © 2012 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Infection and stones can be associated in two ways. Stone disease can occur due to infection by an organism that expresses the urea-splitting enzyme urease (infection stones). Nephrolithiasis can also be complicated by urinary tract infection that in turn was caused by obstruction of the urinary tract by a stone and/or colonization of a pre-existing stone, in both cases by non-urease producing organisms. Although the incidence of infection stones appears to have declined over recent years in the United States, they remain a cause of significant morbidity and mortality. A strong index of suspicion is necessary to identify infection stones before they become large, damage kidneys, or lead to acute morbidity such as urosepsis. Surgery remains the mainstay of therapy for infection stones, combined with careful attention to antibiotic choice based upon appropriate culture results. Use of medical therapy alone is reserved for those relatively unusual cases in which there is a strong contraindication to surgery. Infection-related stones also require prompt recognition, often via use of non-contrast CT. Any obstruction that is present needs to be promptly relieved in order to decompress the kidney and allow the infection to be cleared by antibiotics chosen based upon culture results. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2011. © 2012 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Uremic subjects, in addition to accelerated atherosclerosis, develop diffuse media vascular calcification (VC) which, in turn, is associated with increased vascular stiffness and mortality risk. Two sets of risk factors for VC can be considered: passive deposition of calcium-phosphate and active transformation of vascular smooth muscle cells into osteoblastic-like cells. The former is linked with the metabolic imbalance in divalent ions that affects renal patients at any stage of the disease; the latter is secondary to a recently discovered mechanism of cellular trans-differentiation caused by deranged local concentration of divalent ions. Also, the role of inhibitors of calcification is under investigation. These include circulating or local, substances like fetuin, matrix GLA protein or osteoprotegerin. Their biologic importance is supported by the occurrence of calcification in transgenic animals lacking these factors. Accordingly, VC is a complex biologic and incompletely understood process that deserves further research, in order to develop specific therapeutic strategies. In general, once established, these calcifications are not considered to be reversible; therefore, prevention is the main treatment option. With this aim, in uremic patients it is now recommended to adopt restricted ranges of serum concentrations for calcium, phosphate and parathyroid hormone which are associated with a lower rate of calcification. To target these recommended ranges, new drugs, like selective vitamin D receptor activators, calcium sensing receptor modulators and calcium free intestinal phosphate binders, have been introduced. Moreover new possible pathogenetic pathways are considered (e.g. vitamin K deficiency). Further, in patients with calciphylaxis, the most severe form of VC, experimental therapies are suggested, with drugs like sodium thiosulphate or bisphosphonates. Drugs capable of reversing the process of trans-differentiation from osteoblast-like to vascular smooth muscle cells could be developed in the future. © 2011 Bentham Science Publishers. © 2012 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.; MEDLINE® is the source for the MeSH terms of this document.

AB  - Objective: To examine data showing associations between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels and calcium intake and cardiovascular mortality. Methods: The articles reviewed include those published from 1992-2011 derived from search engines (PubMed, Scopus, Medscape) using the following search terms: vitamin D, calcium, cardiovascular events, cardiovascular mortality, all-cause mortality, vascular calcification, chronic kidney disease, renal stones, and hypercalciuria. Because these articles were not weighted (graded) on the level of evidence, this review reflects my own perspective on the data and how they should be applied to clinical management. Results: For skeletal health, vitamin D and calcium are both needed to ensure proper skeletal growth (modeling) and repair (remodeling). Nutritional deficiencies of either vitamin D or calcium may lead to a spectrum of metabolic bone disorders. Excessive consumption of either nutrient has been linked to a variety of medical disorders, such as hypercalcemia or renal stones. There have also been associations between vitamin D or calcium intake and cardiovascular disease. However, neither of these associations have established evidence nor known causality for increasing cardiovascular risk or all-cause mortality in patients with creatinine clearances greater than 60 mL/min. In patients with more severe chronic kidney disease, stronger data link excess calcium (or phosphorus) intake and increase in vascular calcification, but not mortality. The safe upper limit for vitamin D intake is at least 4000 IU daily and probably 10 000 IU daily; for calcium, the safe upper limit is between 2000 and 3000 mg daily. Conclusions: While no solid scientific evidence validates that serum vitamin D levels between 15 and 70 ng/mL are associated with increased cardiovascular disease risk, stronger but inconsistent evidence shows an association between calcium supplementation greater than 500 mg daily and an increase in cardiovascular disease risk. Most professional societies suggest that replacement levels of these nutrients be personalized with the goal of reaching a 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration between 30 and 50 ng/mL and a calcium intake of 1200 mg daily.

AB  - Milk-alkali syndrome is a rare cause of hypercalcemia characterized by the triad of hypercalcemia, renal insufficiency, and metabolic alkalosis that results from the overconsumption of calcium containing products. In the setting of pregnancy where there is a physiologic increase in calcium absorption, milk-alkali syndrome can be potentially life threatening. We report a case of a 26-year-old woman in her second trimester of pregnancy who presented with 2 weeks of flank pain, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, headache, and lightheadedness. The history revealed consumption of a large quantity of milk, calcium carbonate antacid, and calcium-containing prenatal vitamins. Her symptoms and hypercalcemia resolved with intravenous fluids and a loop diuretic. With the increased use of calcium carbonate for peptic ulcer disease, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and osteoporosis, milk-alkali syndrome has experienced a resurgence and must be considered in the differential diagnosis of hypercalcemia. In this clinical vignette we review the literature on milk-alkali syndrome in pregnancy and discuss important diagnostic and therapeutic considerations when managing the pregnant patient with hypercalcemia. © 2011 Society of General Internal Medicine. © 2013 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.; MEDLINE® is the source for the MeSH terms of this document.

AB  - Background: A suboptimal vitamin D and calcium status has been associated with higher risk of type 2 diabetes in observational studies, but evidence from trials is lacking. Objective: We determined whether vitamin D supplementation, with or without calcium, improved glucose homeostasis in adults at high risk of diabetes. Design: Ninety-two adults were randomly assigned in a 2-by-2 factorial-design, double-masked, placebo-controlled trial to receive either cholecalciferol (2000 IU once daily) or calcium carbonate (400 mg twice daily) for 16 wk. The primary outcome was the change in pancreatic β cell function as measured by the disposition index after an intravenous-glucose-tolerance test. Other outcomes were acute insulin response, insulin sensitivity, and measures of glycemia. Results: Participants had a mean age of 57 y, a body mass index (BMI; in kg/m 2) of 32, and glycated hemoglobin (Hb A <inf>1c</inf>) of 5.9%. There was no significant vitamin D x calcium interaction on any outcomes. The disposition index increased in the vitamin D group and decreased in the no-vitamin D group (adjusted mean change ± SE: 300 ± 130 compared with -126 ± 127, respectively; P = 0.011), which was explained by an improvement in insulin secretion (62 6 39 compared with -36 ± 37 mU • L -1 • min, respectively; P = 0.046). Hb A <inf>1c</inf> increased less, but nonsignificantly, in the vitamin D group than in the no-vitamin D group (0.06 ± 0.03% compared with 0.14 ± 0.03%, respectively; P = 0.081). There was no significant difference in any outcomes with calcium compared with no calcium. Conclusion: In adults at risk of type 2 diabetes, short-term supplementation with cholecalciferol improved β cell function and had a marginal effect on attenuating the rise in Hb A <inf>1c</inf>.

AB  - Renal tubular acidosis (RTA) is a tubulopathy characterized by metabolic acidosis with normal anion gap secondary to abnormalities of renal acidification. RTA can be classified into four main subtypes: distal RTA, proximal RTA, combined proximal and distal RTA, and hyperkalemic RTA. Distal RTA (type 1) is caused by the defect of H + secretion in the distal tubules and is characterized by the inability to acidify the urine below pH 5.5 during systemic acidemia. Proximal RTA (type 2) is caused by an impairment of bicarbonate reabsorption in the proximal tubules and characterized by a decreased renal bicarbonate threshold. Combined proximal and distal RTA (type 3) secondary to a reduction in tubular reclamation of bicarbonate and an inability to acidify the urine in the face of severe acidemia. Hyperkalemic RTA (type 4) may occur as a result of aldosterone deficiency or tubular insensitivity to aldosterone. Clinicians should be alert to the presence of RTA in patients with an unexplained normal anion gap acidosis, hypokalemia, recurrent nephrolithiasis and nephrocalcinosis. The mainstay of treatment of RTA remains alkali replacement. © 2012 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.; MEDLINE® is the source for the MeSH terms of this document.

AB  - Background: A number of disease states and drugs can upset the balance between bone formation and resorption resulting in increased fracture risk. Glucocorticoids are the most recognized cause of secondary osteoporosis. Hypogonadism, weight loss, and chronic inflammation are other contributors to bone loss in a variety of disease states. Bisphosphonates are potent inhibitors of bone resorption, and there is a variety of secondary osteoporosis where they produce substantial increases in bone density and reduce fracture risk by about 50%. Upper gastrointestinal tract intolerance with oral agents and a flu-like syndrome with intravenous bisphosphonates are the principal adverse effects associated with their use. Conclusions: Numerous disease states and medications can adversely affect the skeleton. Additional effects of aging and menopause can substantially increase an individual's fracture risk. It is important that physicians assess fracture risk in susceptible patients and initiate treatment when indicated. © 2011 S.

AB  - Background: The Women's Health Initiative (WHI) randomized clinical trial (RCT) of calcium plus vitamin D (CaD) supplements found a 17% excess in urinary tract stone incidence in the supplemented group. This study evaluated whether this risk is modified by participant characteristics. Objective: We examined the correlates of urinary tract stone occurrence in the CaD arm of the WHI trial. Design: We analyzed an RCT involving 36,282 postmenopausal women aged 50-79 y from 40 WHI centers: 18,176 women received 500 mg calcium carbonate plus 200 IU vitamin D3 twice daily (1000 mg and 400 IU daily, respectively), and 18,106 women received a matching placebo for an average of 7.0 y. The incidence of urinary tract stones was determined. Results: The incidence of self-reported clinically diagnosed urinary tract stones was more common in the active CaD medication group than in the placebo group (hazard ratio: 1.17; 95% CI: 1.02, 1.34): 449 women in the CaD group and 381 women in the placebo group reported a stone during the trial. The rates of self-reported stones did not differ between various demographic, anthropomorphic, dietary, and other hypothesized risk factors according to randomization assignment. Neither the total calcium intake nor the use of calcium supplements at baseline was associated with the risk of stones. In sensitivity analyses that censored participants who were below 80% adherence, the findings were similar. Conclusions: Daily supplementation with CaD for 7 y was associated with an increase in the number of self-reported urinary tract stones. These findings have implications for CaD supplement use.

AB  - Because calcinosis cutis is a rare syndrome, there is a notable lack of controlled clinical trials on its treatment. The efficacy of calcinosis treatment has only been reported in single cases or small case series. No treatment has been generally accepted as standard therapy, although various treatments have been reported to be beneficial, including warfarin, bisphosphonates, minocycline, ceftriaxone, diltiazem, aluminium hydroxide, probenecid, intralesional corticosteroids, intravenous immunoglobulin, curettage, surgical excision, carbon dioxide laser, and extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy. © 2010 by the American Academy of Dermatology, Inc. © 2011 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.; MEDLINE® is the source for the MeSH terms of this document.

AB  - Objectives: To report our experimental results on detection and isolation of nanobacteria-like particles (NLP) from urinary stone samples. Methods: From March 2001 to August 2003, 47 urinary stone samples from Japanese patients and 18 from Paraguayan patients were collected and used for compositional analysis, direct survey of NLP by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and their cultural isolation. For the isolation, culturing was carried out using strict aseptic techniques. Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium with 10% gamma-irradiated fetal bovine serum was used based on the original method described by Kajander and Ciftçioglu. Results: Positive NLP detection rates for Japanese and Paraguayan patient samples were 61.7% (29/47) and 66.7% (12/18), respectively. Positive NLP isolation rates for Japanese patient samples were 20.6% (7/34) and 20.0% (2/10) for Paraguayan patient samples. In the initial isolation, markedly different periods of incubation time were needed for each of the nine cases (6-220days; median 36days). Positive detection and isolation were obtained in stone samples with or without calcium phosphate. Growth modes and morphogenesis of NLP were divided into two phases; rod-shaped NLP was detected mainly as a floating form growing in culture medium and spherical NLP with a characteristic apatite shell was detected as an attached form growing on the surface of culture dishes. Conclusions: Lifeless calcifying nanoparticles can be isolated from various human urinary stones, cultured in cell culture mediums and show two characteristic growth phases. © 2011 The Japanese Urological Association. © 2011 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.; MEDLINE® is the source for the MeSH terms of this document.

AB  - Aim : To compare efficacy and tolerability of phytotherapy (PT) vs. potassium citrate (KC) in patients with minimal nephrolithiasis. To compare and assess changes in value of certain serum (Ca2+ , PO<inf>4</inf> 3- , uric acid [UA]) and urinary (24-hr Ca2+ , PO <inf>4</inf>3- , UA, citrate, oxalate, and urine pH) parameters in patients being treated with PT or KC. Materials and Methods : After clearance by the local institutional ethics committee, 60 patients of nephrolithiasis who had consented for the study, were enrolled (as per entry criteria) and randomized into citrate therapy (group-I) or PT (group-II). PT was administered as a nutritional supplement, using a lupeol-based extract (Tablet Calcury, two tablets twice a day). They were monitored for the changes in the serum and urinary biochemical, radiological, and clinical parameters (efficacy and tolerability) as per protocol. Results : Group-I patients demonstrated favorable changes in certain biochemical parameters (decreased serum calcium, urinary UA/oxalate, increased urinary citrate and pH) along with significant symptomatic improvement (decrease in visual analogue pain score with increased stone clearance/reduction in stone size). Four (13.3%) patients of group-I had mild upper gastrointestinal discomfort which was controlled with antacids. Group-II patients had favorable changes in biochemical parameters (decreased serum UA and increased urinary citrate) along with significant symptomatic improvement (reduction/clearance in the stone size), but without any noticeable side effects. Conclusions : Medical therapies with both KC and PT (with lupeol extract using Calcury) were effective in reducing the stone size and symptoms of nephrolithiasis. It appeared that KC was biochemically efficacious in producing some favorable biochemical changes with some side effects, whereas PT was probably clinically efficacious in hastening stone expulsion (<8 mm) without any observed adverse events. Although both the medical therapies were not effective in all aspects, we believe that PT using lupeol-based extract (Calcury) may be used as an alternative form of medical therapy in select patients with minimal nephrolithiasis. Long-term randomized placebo-controlled trials are needed to better define the precise role of lupeol-based PT vs. citrate therapy in minimal nephrolithiasis. © 2011 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper presents a study that investigates the destructive energy output resulting from hydrodynamic bubbly cavitation in microchannels and its potential use in biomedical applications. The research performed in this study includes results from bubbly cavitation experiments and findings showing the destructive effects of bubbly cavitating flow on selected solid specimens and live cells. The bubbles generated by hydrodynamic cavitation are highly destructive at the surfaces of the target medium on which they are carefully focused. The resulting destructive energy output could be effectively used for biomedical treatments, such as destroying kidney stones (renal calculi) or killing cancer cells. Motivated by this potential, the cavitation damage to cancerous cells and material removal from chalk pieces (which possess similar material properties as some kidney stones) was investigated. Our results showed that cavitation could induce damage both on chalk pieces and leukemia/lymphoma cells. We discovered that hydrodynamic cavitation exposure had early and delayed effects on cancer cell survival. Hence, the potential of hydrodynamic bubbly cavitation generated at the microscale for biomedical treatments was revealed using the microchannel configuration as a microorifice (with an inner diameter of 147 μm and a length of 1.52 cm), which acts as the source of bubbly cavitating flows. © 2006 IEEE. © 2011 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.; MEDLINE® is the source for the MeSH terms of this document.

AB  - Background: A giant urinary tract calculus is not common in modern urological practice. The bladder has been known to harbour very large stones, weighing hundreds of grams, some with bearable symptoms, for a long time. These giant stones account for less than 1% of all urinary tract calculi. The aim of the present report is to highlight our management of a series of giant urinary tract calculi. Methods: A series of 14 patients were seen over 5years (2004-2009) with giant urinary tract calculi and were studied in detail using their hospital records. Their biodata, clinical presentation, presence of urinary tract obstruction or infection, diagnostic investigations, operative management, and physical and chemical characteristics of the calculi were reviewed. Results: There were 13 males and one female, and their ages ranged between 4 and 79years (median 30.5). Ten patients had bladder calculi, one ureteric in combination with a staghorn renal calculus, a second stone in the urethra and two huge staghorn calculi in non-functioning kidneys. The mean weight of the calculi was 153.3±69.6 (range 25-300g) and the chemical compositions were mainly calcium oxalate, struvite (triple phosphate) and calcium carbonate. All the stones were radio-opaque and two were associated with non-functioning kidneys, and there was no congenital anatomical defect causing obstruction in any of the patients. Conclusion: Giant urinary tract calculi are most common in the male urinary bladder and are managed by open surgery with very good outcome. There were no anatomical abnormalities causing narrowing in the urinary tract in any of the cases. © 2011 The Authors.

AB  - The mineral composition of 7819 small animal uroliths in the UK was determined by semi-quantitative X-ray diffraction over a period of 90. months from 2002 to 2010. Canine and feline uroliths constituted 97% of the study population and the mineral phase detected most frequently was struvite (43%), followed by calcium oxalate (41%). Uroliths from crossbreeds, Dalmatians, Yorkshire terriers and Shih Tzus accounted for almost 30% of all canine uroliths, with the highest frequency in Dalmatians, which had a predominance of urate uroliths. The average ages of dogs and cats with uroliths were 7.0. years and 7.4. years, respectively. The ratio of the number of dogs presenting with struvite compared to oxalate phases reached a maximum at 3. years of age. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd. © 2011 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.; MEDLINE® is the source for the MeSH terms of this document.

AB  - Urolithiasis in countries like India presents an important economic repercussion where cattle - based agriculture is strongly linked with the livelihood of an important segment of the population. Investigations on clinical studies on obstructive urolithiasis in cattle calves, were carried out from October 2006 - April 2008 with the objectives of studying the aetiopathogenesis of the disease. Thirty clinical cases of obstructive urolithiasis with 15 ruptured and 15 intact urinary bladders were brought to the clinics for the treatment during the study period. Diagnosis of the disease was made on the basis of history of anuria, clinical signs, radiographic, ultrasonographic, haematobiochemical, and peritoneal fluid examinations. Most of the calves suffering from obstructive urolithiasis had the history of feeding on diets containing wheat bran, commercial cattle feed, rice bran and rice straw. Wheat bran alone and in combination with other feed and fodder was given to maximum 76.66 per cent calves. Herbal litholytic agent (Tab. Cystone) was the most commonly used medication, which was used alone in 19 per cent and in combination with other drugs in 47.61 per cent cases. Under field conditions diuretics were the second most common drugs administered to the calves under study, before their presentation at the faculty clinics. In 90 per cent cases struvite was the only component of the calculi, while in rest of the cases other minor components like calcium phosphate, calcium carbonate, oxalate etc., were also found. High concentrate feeding with little provision of water during winter months seemed to be the most prominent predisposing factors for the development of the disease. © 2011 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Purpose. The most recent large-scale studies evaluating the effects of calcium supplementation for prevention of osteoporosis-related fractures in postmenopausal women are reviewed. Summary. Osteoporosis is a very common disease associated with significant morbidity and mortality. For many years, use of a calcium supplement (preferably in combination with vitamin D to optimize calcium absorption) has been recommended for postmenopausal women to decrease fracture risk. However, five large-scale, randomized, controlled trials have called into question the benefits of calcium in reducing fracture risk, and four of the studies indicated that calcium users may be at increased risk for renal stones and gastrointestinal problems. However, all five studies had one or more important limitations, including possible selection bias and study participants' relatively high baseline calcium intake and generally low adherence to treatment regimens. Moreover, in some of the studies, vitamin D was not included in the treatment protocol or was not used at levels sufficient to optimize calcium absorption. In three of the five trials, subgroup analysis of the most treatment-adherent participants indicated significant reductions in osteoporotic fracture risk with calcium supplement use. Conclusion. Results of recent clinical trials indicate that calcium supplementation does not significantly reduce fracture risk in postmenopausal women. However, evidence from the same studies suggests that beneficial effects on fracture risk may be seen in women who are adherent to therapy. Postmenopausal women should continue calcium supplementation to reduce osteoporosis risk. Copyright © 2011, American Society of Health-System Pharmacists, Inc.

AB  - Background: Stone composition has changed substantially over the past decades in developed countries. We studied urinary stone composition in Tunisian children. Methods: We studied 205 children ranging from 3 months to 16 years old age and who were diagnosed as having urinary stones (122 boys and 83 girls). Stone analysis was performed respectively using a stereomicroscope and by infrared spectroscopy to determine, respectively, the morphological type and molecular composition of each. Results: Of 205 stones analysed, 77 (37.5%) were composed of a single constituent. Calcium oxalate (CaOx) stone were predominant, being a constituent of 54.7% of stones, followed by calcium phosphate and purines; 14.6% of cases. Calcium oxalate monohydrate was more frequently seen in girls (p<0.01), while struvite was more common in boys (p<0.001). Teenagers were more affected by whewellite stones compared with infants (p<0.05). Purine stones were predominant in 20% of cases, but its prevalence decreased with age. Conclusions: The increase in calcium oxalate stones in school age children and the decrease of struvite and purines stones confirm the change in the etiology of urolithiasis with respect to age. © 2011 by Walter de Gruyter. © 2011 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.; MEDLINE® is the source for the MeSH terms of this document.

AB  - This chapter discusses melamine and cyanuric acid. Melamine is a small nitrogen-rich molecule used in the manufacture of plastics, adhesives, cleaners and yellow dye. Melamine is polymerized with formaldehyde to produce a variety of durable resins, adhesives, cleansers and flame retardants. Cyanuric acid, an intermediate produced during melamine manufacture and degradation, is commonly used to stabilize chlorine in swimming pools. Melamine, and its structural analog cyanuric acid, are rapidly absorbed and rapidly excreted almost completely unmetabolized in the urine. Cats and dogs ingesting contaminated food with melamine and cyanuric acid had evidence of renal failure. Clinical signs included inappetence, vomiting, polyuria, polydipsia and lethargy. Clinical signs of renal failure in children that consumed contaminated milk products were relatively subtle and nondescript. The most common symptoms described in these children were increased or reduced frequency of urination or anuria, stranguria and unexplained crying. Hematuria and the presence of stones in urine were also reported. The combination of melamine and cyanuric acid is markedly more toxic to most animals than either compound when given alone. To date, there is no evidence that melamine or cyanuric acid is a reproductive and developmental toxicant. The basic treatment regimens for crystalluria and urolithiasis related to melamine ingestion include fluid therapy and supportive care in both veterinary and pediatric patients. Increased water intake and fluid therapy were used to increase urine output. Sodium bicarbonate or potassium citrate was added to intravenous fluids for this purpose. Antispasmodic drugs such as anisodamine or atropine were given to facilitate excretion of uroliths in children and pain management was instituted. Melamine is produced in large volumes and used around the world for a variety of purposes. Kidney is the target organ for melamine, cyanuric acid and related analogs. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Drug-induced urinary calculi, although they account for only 1-2% of urinary calculi, deserve consideration because most of them are preventable. In the drug-containing calculi resulting from the crystallization of a certain drug and its metabolites in the urine, stone analysis can identify the responsible drug. While, in the drug-induced metabolic calculi caused by interference with calcium, oxalate and purine metabolism, careful clinical inquiry is necessary to reveal involvement of a certain drug in stone formation. Better awareness of the possible drugs with lithogenic potential and close surveillance of patients on long-term treatment with these drugs are necessary. Especially, in patients with a history of urolithiaisis, prescription of lithogenic drugs deserve careful consideration.

AB  - The combination of calcium with vitamin D (vitamin D3 colecalciferol) forms the basis of preventive and therapeutic regimens for osteoporosis. A number of studies have suggested that the combination of calcium and vitamin D is effective when administered at respective dosages of at least 1200mg and 800IU per day, although efficacy is, as expected, affected by patient compliance. Overall, treatment with this combination appears to be effective in reducing the incidence of non-vertebral and hip fractures. Also, in all drug studies (of antiresorptive and anabolic agents and strontium ranelate) that demonstrated a reduction in risk of osteoporotic fractures, patients also took calcium and vitamin D supplements. An important finding in this regard is that vitamin D levels have been demonstrated to be inadequate in more than half of women treated for osteoporosis in the US and Europe.The capacity of the small intestine to absorb calcium salts depends on the solubility and ionization of the salts. These properties vary for different salts, with fasting calcium citrate absorption being greater than that of calcium lactogluconate and calcium carbonate. Calcium citrate formulations taken between meals may help to prevent abdominal distension and flatulence, as well as minimize the risk of renal calculus formation, thus helping to optimize patient compliance. Therefore, calcium citrate combined with vitamin D is the combination of choice for the prevention or treatment of osteoporosis. © 2011 Adis Data Information BV.

AB  - Urolithiasis is a worldwide problem with significant health and economic burdens. Medical therapy that alters the course of stone disease has enormous medical and financial impact. Urolithiasis is a final manifestation of a broad range of etiologies and pathogenesis. The modest progress in understanding the pathophysiology has hampered successful development of targeted therapy. Current regimens are based mostly on rational alteration of urinary biochemistry and physical chemistry to lower the risk of precipitation. In terms of pharmacotherapy, there are drugs to successfully improve hypercalciuria, hypocitraturia, aciduria, hyperuricosuria, and hypercystinuria. These agents have been proven to be effective in randomized controlled trials in improving urinary biochemical and physicochemical risk factors, as well as clinical outcomes. Although our current regimens have clearly improved the management and lives of stone formers, there are still clearly identifiable immense voids in the knowledge of pathophysiology of stone disease that can be filled with combined basic science and clinical studies. © 2011 International Society of Nephrology. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Calculi obtained from 30 clinical cases of obstructive urolithiasis in male calves during surgery were subjected to complete analysis including physical, microscopic and chemical examination. Cystic lumen and neck, jointly, were the commonest site of calculi retrieval (47%) cases, followed by cystic neck (33%) cases and cystic lumen (20%) cases. In majority (90%) of the cases small multiple calculi were retrieved. The calculi retrieved were usually as free sandy material mixed with blood and other tissue debris but in 3 cases a mass comprising of calculi embedded in blood clot and tissue debris was retrieved from cystic lumen. The urethral calculi were either loop shaped or impacted sandy material. Microscopic examination revealed that one or more well defined nuclei (nidus) were found in each concretion. The nuclei and the surrounding concentric layers of laminae were enclosed by a single capsule. The calculi were composed of magnesium ammonium phosphate, calcium phosphate, calcium carbonate, calcium oxalate, hippuric acid, tyrosine and uric acid. Twenty three (77%) calculi samples were composed of magnesium ammonium phosphate only. © 2011 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The search of literature showed Urolithiasis as a multifactorial recurrent disease, distributed worldwide in urban, rural, non industrial and industrial regions with different chemical composition of analyzed stones in context to various etiological and risk factors. The present study was aimed to qualitatively analyze the uroliths obtained by surgical intervention at Krishna hospital Karad, a South West region in Maharashtra (India), to evaluate the predominant constituent present in them and report its significance. The study reported, urolithiasis was more suffered by individuals between the age group of 30 to 60 years with more predominance in males than females. The chemical analysis of uroliths showed that all the assessed stones were of mixed heterogeneous type, Magnesium Ammonium Phosphate (71.2%) was predominant constituent followed by Calcium Oxalate (68.8%), Calcium Carbonate (64.0%), Urate (44.8%), Cystine (12.8%), Xanthine (2.4%) and Fibrin (1.6%). The study concludes simple qualitative laboratory based method for assessing chemical composition of various uroliths allowed a reliable diagnosis of stone contents whose data may be useful in advising the people of this region for taking preventive measures for reducing the risk of prevalence and recurrence of urolithiasis in them. © 2011 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - This project sought to test the ability of commercial stone analysis laboratories to correctly analyze urinary stones. Human stone specimens were cleaved into pieces, and the pieces of each specimen were verified as being similar using micro-computed tomography (micro CT), a non-destructive method. Thus, similar specimens from 25 stones were sent to five laboratories, and a sixth piece was kept for analysis in our laboratory using Fourier- transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). The results showed that laboratories were very good at analyzing pure specimens, but with mixed specimens the accuracy and consistency varied. In six stones containing apatite, a min eral easily identiied using micro CT, apatite was missed 20% of the time. Struvite content in the specimens was inconsistently reported, with laboratories differing in their reports of the presence of struvite in six of the 25 stones (24%). A mixed stone containing atazanavir was not reported by any of the laboratories as containing that drug. Nomenclature difered among the laboratories, especially with regard to apatite, which was variously reported as hydroxyapatite, carbonate apatite, or as apatite with calcium carbonate. One laboratory reported protein in every stone, while for all others protein was reported in only one stone. We conclude that physicians need to be aware that reports on mixed stones, which represent > 90% of all calculi, can be erroneous. It is likely that supplying a greater amount of stone material will assist a laboratory in making a correct analysis of mixed stones. Also, standardization of nomenclature could assist in analysis reproducibility, but this remains to be tested. © Springer-Verlag 2010. © 2011 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.; MEDLINE® is the source for the MeSH terms of this document.

AB  - Spherulitic crystals are found in association with many materials and diseases, but the fundamental formation mechanism is not well understood. Using maleic chitosan to control CaCO<inf>3</inf> crystallization, we have discovered a two-stage process that produces biomimetic CaCO<inf>3</inf> spherulites. First, amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC) films are formed from which amorphous nanoparticles are precipitated, deposited, and stabilized to form an ACC core. This core then acts as a nucleus for the radial growth of needlelike calcite subunits. Accordingly, the resulting crystals combine the coexistence of calcite and ACC found in composite skeletal elements and the radially ordered structure of spherulitic biominerals. In conjunction with previous studies of spherulites in plants and animals, these findings may provide new insights into spherulitic crystallization, including the formation of spherulitic biominerals in nature. They may also have important implications for the understanding and potential treatment of diseases in which amorphous cores have already been observed, such as Alzheimers disease and kidney stones. © 2010 American Chemical Society. © 2011 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Tubular occlusion from red blood cell casts secondary to immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN) is a rare, serious complication of tonsillitis that can cause acute renal failure, also referred to as acute kidney injury. IgAN is the most common primary glomerulonephritis with up to 20% of cases resulting in renal failure worldwide. Tonsillectomy is an effective treatment option for patients suffering from IgAN secondary to recurrent acute tonsillitis. Tonsillectomy alone or in combination with additional medical modalities improves renal function and can have a positive effect on long-term renal survival. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Purpose: We determined the accuracy of stone composition analysis at commercial laboratories. Materials and Methods: A total of 25 human renal stones with infrared spectroscopy determined composition were fragmented into aliquots and studied with micro computerized tomography to ensure fragment similarity. Representative fragments of each stone were submitted to 5 commercial stone laboratories for blinded analysis. Results: All laboratories agreed on the composition of 6 pure stones. Only 2 of 4 stones (50%) known to contain struvite were identified as struvite at all laboratories. Struvite was reported as a component by some laboratories for 4 stones previously determined not to contain struvite. Overall there was disagreement regarding struvite in 6 stones (24%). For 9 calcium oxalate stones all laboratories reported some mixture of calcium oxalate but the quantity of subtypes differed significantly among laboratories. In 6 apatite containing stones apatite was missed by the laboratories in 20% of samples. None of the laboratories identified atazanavir in a stone containing that antiviral drug. One laboratory reported protein in every sample while all others reported it in only 1. Nomenclature for apatite differed among laboratories with 1 reporting apatite as carbonate apatite and never hydroxyapatite, another never reporting carbonate apatite and always reporting hydroxyapatite, and a third reporting carbonate apatite as apatite with calcium carbonate. Conclusions: Commercial laboratories reliably recognize pure calculi. However, variability in the reporting of mixed calculi suggests a problem with the accuracy of stone analysis results. There is also a lack of standard nomenclature used by laboratories. © 2010 American Urological Association Education and Research, Inc. © 2012 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.; MEDLINE® is the source for the MeSH terms of this document.

AB  - The presence of diverticula arising from the calyceal system is a relatively uncommon urological problem, occurring with an incidence of 2.1-4.5 per 1000 intravenous urogram (IVU) examinations. While the incidence of calyceal diverticula is low, the frequency of stone formation within them is high. We describe the aetiology and clinical presentation and describe the role of imaging with ultrasound, intravenous and retrograde pyelography and CT in diagnosis and planning treatment. We also describe the potential of fluid-sensitive magnetic resonance imaging techniques as a radiation-free alternative to the use of more conventional modalities, such as intravenous urography and retrograde pyelography, in delineating the anatomy of calyceal diverticula before surgical and radiological intervention especially in young patients and pregnant women. © 2010 The British Institute of Radiology. © 2011 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.; MEDLINE® is the source for the MeSH terms of this document.

AB  - Urinary stones resected from urinary bladders of patients hailing from Kollam district of Kerala State, India were analyzed by SEM, XRD and by thermal analysis techniques. The analytical results indicate that, stones have different composition, i.e., calcium phosphate, calcium phosphate hydroxide and sodium calcium carbonate. Infrared spectral studies also reveal the presence of phosphates or carbonates in these samples. Further, IR spectral investigations have revealed that amorphous carbonated species are occupied in PO <inf>4</inf> sites in calcium phosphate type stone and OH sites in calcium phosphate hydroxide sample. Thermal studies of these samples also reveal that, carbon dioxide is released from carbonated samples upon heating which is related to amount of carbon content and bond strength. Crystals with defects and irregular morphology are grown inside the urinary bladder due to variation in crystal growth conditions. © 2010 Elsevier B.V. © 2012 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.; MEDLINE® is the source for the MeSH terms of this document.

AB  - Background and purpose: Urolithiasis is one of the most common diseases of urinary tract. Abdominal colicky pain, nausia, vomiting and hematuria are the major clinical findings. Treatments including oral drugs, lithitripsy, using ureteroscope and open surgery are expensive and may result in significant complications. The aim of this research was to find medications for dissolution of urinary stones with less complication. Materials and methods: Variable concentrations of juniper fruit extract including 200, 500 and 1000 μg / ml solutions were used in vitro on urinary stones. Neutral (normal saline), positive (sodium bicarbonate) and negative (acetic acid) control groups were also prepared. Results: Significant findings were obtained on urinary stones composed of calcium oxalate (60%), calcium phosphate (30%) and ammonium phosphate (10%). The weight of dry powder of stones in normal saline of 1400 mg decreased to 1310 , 1240 and 1120 mg after exposure to increasing concentrations of juniper fruit extract. Also the ratio of calcium oxalate in normal saline aqueous solution plus stone increased from 65% to 85% after using juniper fruit extract. Conclusion: Juniper fruit extract can dissolve urinary stones in vitro. © 2010 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Objective: Studies evaluating the influence of age and gender on the distribution of the various types of paediatric urinary calculi are scarce. Aim of our study was to highlight the modification of epidemiological characteristics of this pathology depending on patients' age and gender. Patients and methods We present the results of a study based on 205 calculi (from 122 boys and 83 girls) analyzed by infrared spectroscopy between 1993 and 2007. 54.6% of the patients were under 5 years. Results: Calcium oxalate (CaOx) was the predominant constituent in 54.7% of stones, followed by calcium phosphate and ammonium urate (14.6% each). We found a male preponderance for struvite stones (12.3% vs 1.2%), and an increasing prevalence of calcium oxalate stones with age (42.9% in infants vs 59.3% in older children). Purines stones were observed in 20% of cases, but their prevalence decreases with age (28.6% in infants vs 18.5% in old children). Conclusion: the increase of calcium oxalate stone rate in school age children and the decrease of purines stones confirm the change on the etiology of urolithiasis according to age. © 2011 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.; MEDLINE® is the source for the MeSH terms of this document.

AB  - Three major conditions control the potential for uric acid stones: the quantitative excretion of uric acid, the volume of urine as it affects the urinary concentration of uric acid and the urinary pH. However, the most important factor for uric acid stone formation is acid urinary pH that is a prerequisite for uric acidic stone formation. Indeed the goal standard of urinary alkalization is to achieve a pH of 6-6.5. Administration of alkali should be titrated appropriately by pH paper to record urinary pH until a steady state is achieved. Alkali therapy such as sodium bicarbonate and potassium citrate has been advocated on the basis of established clinical experience, although potassium citrate should be preferred because it may avoid the complication of calcium salt precipitation. Recently it has been reported the clinical efficacy of therapy with potassium citrate/potassium bicarbonate for dissolution of radiolucent stones respect to control study period (only water daily intake of 1500 ml). Furthemore, mean urinary pH was significantly continuously higher during the alkali treatment study in comparison to the control study period, even though the mean of urinary volumes were similar in the two periods. In conclusion urinary alkalization with maintaining continuously high urinary pH values, could be the treatment of choice for stone dissolution and prevention of uric acid stones. © 2011 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.; MEDLINE® is the source for the MeSH terms of this document.

AB  - The mechanisms involved in biomineralization are modulated through interactions with organic matrix. In the case of stone formation, the role of the organic macromolecules in the complex urinary environment is not clear, but the presence of mineralogical 'signatures' suggests that some aspects of stone formation may result from a non-classical crystallization process that is induced by acidic proteins. An amorphous precursor has been detected in many biologically controlled mineralization reactions, which is thought to be regulated by non-specific interactions between soluble acidic proteins and mineral ions. Using in vitro model systems, we find that a liquid-phase amorphous mineral precursor induced by acidic polypeptides can lead to crystal textures that resemble those found in Randall's plaque and kidney stones. This polymer-induced liquid-precursor process leads to agglomerates of coalesced mineral spherules, dense-packed spherulites with concentric laminations, mineral coatings and 'cements', and collagen-associated mineralization. Through the use of in vitro model systems, the mechanisms involved in the formation of these crystallographic features may be resolved, enhancing our understanding of the potential role(s) that proteins play in stone formation. © 2010 Springer-Verlag. © 2011 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.; MEDLINE® is the source for the MeSH terms of this document.

AB  - Calcium oxalate stone formation occurs under pathological conditions and accounts for more than 80% of all types of kidney stones. In the current study, we show for the first time that calcium oxalate stones are formed in the mouse inner ear of a genetic model for hearing loss and vestibular dysfunction in humans. The vestibular system within the inner ear is dependent on extracellular tiny calcium carbonate minerals for proper function. Thousands of these biominerals, known as otoconia, are associated with the utricle and saccule sensory maculae and are vital for mechanical stimulation of the sensory hair cells.We show that a missense mutation within the Slc26a4 gene abolishes the transport activity of its encoded protein, pendrin. As a consequence, dramatic changes in mineral composition, size, and shape occur within the utricle and saccule in a differential manner. Although abnormal giant carbonate minerals reside in the utricle at all ages, in the saccule, a gradual change in mineral composition leads to a formation of calcium oxalate in adult mice. By combining imaging and spectroscopy tools, we determined the profile of mineral composition and morphology at different time points. We propose a novel mechanism for the accumulation and aggregation of oxalate crystals in the inner ear. © 2010 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc. © 2010 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.; MEDLINE® is the source for the MeSH terms of this document.

AB  - Introduction: Introduction and Objectives Prostate stones are frequently encountered duriñóng transurethral resection of the prostate in urology practice. We aimed to demonstrate the physical and chemical properties of prostate stones. We also aimed to determine possible relationship between inflammation of prostate gland and prostate stones. Methods: The consecutive patients (excluding subjects with PSA<4 ng/ml and urolithiasis), who underwent TURP operation and who were observed to have prostatic calculi duriñóng TURP, were included in the study. The prostatic stones obtained from each patient duriñóng TURP were analysed for chemical composition and observed under electron microscopy (SEM) for structure and surface morphology. The pathological specimens were assessed by the uropathologist for the final diagnosis and existence and degree of inflammation. Results: Five patients were included in the study. From each patient at least three (range 38) samples of stones (diameter varying from 1 mm up to 5 mm) were obtained. The stones were made of mixed composition of calcium phosphate and calcium carbonate. The stones were found to have lobular surface made up of small spheres under SEM. Histopathological examination of the TURP specimens revealed being prostatic hyperplasia accompanied with inflammation of mild to severe degree. Conclusions: Prostatic stones are concentrically precipitated calcium stones within the prostatic ductuli with granular grape like morphology. Histopathological inflammation seems to be associated with these prostatic calculi. © 2010 AEU. Published by Elsevier España, S.L. All rights reserved. © 2011 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Sodium bicarbonate, sodium citrate and potassium citrate cause alkalinisation of the urine. They may be given to relieve urinary discomfort in mild urinary tract infections and to prevent the development of uric acid renal calculi in the initial stages of uricosuric therapy for hyperuricaemia. Sodium bicarbonate is also used parenterally to correct metabolic acidosis and orally as an antacid. This article provides a brief review of the therapeutic role of alkalinising agents for alkalinisation of the urine and for the neutralisation of acid secretions in the gastrointestinal tract. © 2010 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The biomineral calcium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate (CaHPO4·2H2O), known as brushite, is a malleable material that both grows and dissolves faster than most other calcium minerals, including other calcium phosphate phases, calcium carbonates and calcium oxalates. Within the body, this ready formation and dissolution can play a role in certain diseases, such as kidney stone and plaque formation. However, these same properties, along with brushite’s excellent biocompatibility, can be used to great benefit in making resorbable biomedical cements. To optimize cements, additives are commonly used to control crystallization kinetics and phase transformation. This paper describes the use of in situ scanning probe microscopy to investigate the role of several solution parameters and additives in brushite atomic step motion. Surprisingly, this work demonstrates that the activation barrier for phosphate (rather than calcium) incorporation limits growth kinetics and that additives such as magnesium, citrate and bisphosphonates each influence step motion in distinctly different ways. Our findings provide details of how, and where, molecules inhibit or accelerate kinetics. These insights have the potential to aid in designing molecules to target specific steps and to guide synergistic combinations of additives. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) has a variable clinical presentation and symptomatic PHPT is still the predominant form of the disease in India. Data from western India is lacking. Aim: To present the clinical profile of PHPT from western India. Settings and Design: This retrospective study was conducted at a tertiary care referral center. Materials and Methods: We analyzed the clinical presentation, biochemical, radiological features, and operative findings in adult patients with PHPT (1986-2008) and compared with our published data of children and adolescent patients with PHPT. Statistical Analysis: was done with SPSS 16 software. Results: Seventy-nine patients (F: M-2:1) with age ranging from 21 to 55 years (mean 33.5±8.82) were analyzed. Skeletal manifestations (75.5%), renal calculi (40.5%) and proximal muscle weakness (45.5%) were the most common symptoms of presentation with mean duration of symptoms being 33.70 (median: 24, range 1-120) months. Biochemical features included hypercalcemia (total corrected calcium 12.55±1.77 mg/dl), low inorganic phosphorus (1.81±0.682 mg/dl), elevated total alkaline phosphatase (mean: 762.2; median: 559; range: 50-4930IU/L) and high parathyroid hormone (PTH) (mean±SD: 866.61±799.15; median: 639.5; range: 52-3820 pg/ml). Preoperative localization was achieved in 74 patients and single adenoma was found during surgery in 72 patients. Hungry bone disease was seen in 30.3% and transient hypoparathyroidism developed in 62% patients. In comparison to PHPT in children there were no significant differences with regard to clinical, laboratory and radiological features. Conclusions: PHPT in western India is symptomatic disorder with skeletal and renal mani-festations at a much younger age. Clinical profile of PHPT in children is similar to that of adults. © 2010 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.; MEDLINE® is the source for the MeSH terms of this document.

AB  - Background: Vitamin D insufficiency, which is prevalent in older individuals, is associated with bone and muscle weakness and falls. Objective: We examined the effects of a weekly dose of 8400 IU vitamin D<inf>3</inf> on postural stability, muscle strength, and safety. Design: In this double-blind trial, subjects aged ≥70 y with serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentrations ≤20 but ≥6 ng/mL were randomly assigned to receive a weekly dose of 8400 IU vitamin D<inf>3</inf> (n = 114) or a placebo (n = 112). Mediolateral body sway with eyes open (assessed with the AccuSwayPLUS platform; Advanced Medical Technology Inc, Watertown, MA) was the primary endpoint. Secondary endpoints included the short physical performance battery (SPPB) and serum 25(OH)D concentrations. An analysis of covariance model was used for treatment comparisons. Safety and tolerability were monitored. Results: Serum 25(OH)D concentrations rose significantly (from 13.9 to 26.2 ng/mL, P < 0.001) in patients treated with 8400 IU vitamin D<inf>3</inf> but not in patients treated with the placebo. After 16 wk, neither mediolateral sway nor SPPB differed significantly between treatment groups. However, in the post hoc analysis of patients subgrouped by baseline sway (≥0.46 compared with <0.46 cm), treatment with 8400 IU vitamin D<inf>3</inf> significantly reduced sway compared with treatment with placebo (P = 0.047) in patients with elevated baseline sway but not in patients with normal baseline sway. Adverse experiences and incidences of hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, and elevated creatinine were similar with both treatments. In patients treated with 8400 IU vitamin D<inf>3</inf>, but not in placebotreated patients, parathyroid hormone decreased significantly. Conclusions: Weekly treatment with 8400 IU vitamin D<inf>3</inf> raised 25(OH)D concentrations in elderly, vitamin D-insufficient individuals. Treatment with 8400 IU vitamin D<inf>3</inf> did not reduce mediolateral sway significantly compared with treatment with placebo in this population, although in post hoc analysis, treatment with 8400 IU vitamin D <inf>3</inf> reduced sway in the subgroup of patients who had elevated sway at baseline. Weekly treatment with 8400 IU vitamin D<inf>3</inf> was well tolerated.

AB  - QUESTION: In addition to suffering from nausea and vomiting of pregnancy, which is being treated with antiemetics, some of my pregnant patients complain of heartburn and acid reflux. Should these symptoms also be treated and, if so, which acid-reducing medications are safe for use during pregnancy? ANSWER: Increased severity of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy is associated with the presence of heartburn and acid reflux. Antacids, histamine-2 receptor antagonists, and proton pump inhibitors can be used safely during pregnancy, as large studies have been published with no evidence of adverse fetal effects. © 2012 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.; MEDLINE® is the source for the MeSH terms of this document.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine adverse effects, adverse events, and potential interactions of vitamins in light of their current prevalence of use, and to discuss whether vitamins should be considered over-the-counter drugs or natural health products/dietary supplements. DATA SOURCES : We performed a MEDLINE/PubMed search, explored 4 online databases (Medline Plus, Drug Digest, Natural Medicine Comprehensive Database, and the database of the University of Maryland), and examined reference lists of included studies published from 1966 through October 2009. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: The studies were reviewed, with an emphasis on randomized controlled clinical trials. We included articles with the most clinically important information with regard to adverse events and interactions. DATA SYNTHESIS: Vitamins are used by over one third of the North American population. Vitamins have documented adverse effects and toxicities, and most have documented interactions with drugs. While some vitamins (biotin, pantothenic acid, riboflavin, thiamine, vitamin B12, vitamin K) have minor and reversible adverse effects, others, such as fat-soluble vitamins (A, E, D), can cause serious adverse events. Two water-soluble vitamins, folic acid and niacin, can also have significant toxicities and adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: Our recommendation is that vitamins A, E, D, folic acid, and niacin should be categorized as over-the-counter medications. Labeling of vitamins, especially those intended for children and other vulnerable groups, should include information on possible toxicities, dosing, recommended upper intake limits, and concurrent use with other products. Vitamin A should be excluded from multivitamin supplements and food fortificants. © 2010 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.; MEDLINE® is the source for the MeSH terms of this document.

AB  - This report from the Medical Advisory Secretariat (MAS) was intended to evaluate the clinical utility of vitamin D testing in average risk Canadians and in those with kidney disease. As a separate analysis, this report also includes a systematic literature review of the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in these two subgroups. This evaluation did not set out to determine the serum vitamin D thresholds that might apply to non-bone health outcomes. For bone health outcomes, no high or moderate quality evidence could be found to support a target serum level above 50 nmol/L. Similarly, no high or moderate quality evidence could be found to support vitamin D's effects in non-bone health outcomes, other than falls. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Most current guidelines recommend that older adults and the elderly strive for a total calcium intake (diet and supplements) of 1,000 to 1,300 mg/day to prevent osteoporosis and fractures. Traditionally, calcium supplements have been considered safe, effective and well tolerated, but their safety has recently been questioned due to potential adverse effects on vascular disease which may increase mortality. For example, the findings from a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (currently published in abstract form only) revealed that the use of calcium supplements was associated with an ~30% increased risk of myocardial infarction. If high levels of calcium are harmful to health, this may alter current public health recommendations with regard to the use of calcium supplements for preventing osteoporosis. In this review, we provide an overview of the latest information from human observational and prospective studies, randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses related to the effects of calcium supplementation on vascular disease and related risk factors, including blood pressure, lipid and lipoprotein levels and vascular calcification. © 2010 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - CASE HISTORY: A 3-year-old male, castrated Saanen goat was presented with an acute onset of vocalisation, abdominal discomfort and ‘tail-flagging’. CLINICAL FINDINGS: Radiographs, including a positive-contrast study, indicated obstructive urolithiasis, and evidence of rupture of the urethra. Analysis of uroliths identified calcium carbonate crystals. Amputation of the urethral process could not re-establish urethral patency, so a tube cystotomy was performed but also was not successful. Eighteen days after admission, a perineal urethrostomy was performed. However, the goat’s condition deteriorated 12 days after the urethrostomy, and the owner consented to euthanasia of the animal. Post-mortem examination revealed a hole 2 × 1 cm on the dorsal aspect of the bladder, and a necrotic focus measuring approximately 2 × 3 cm ventrally. DIAGNOSIS: Obstructive urolithiasis, with ruptured bladder and urethra. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Obstructive urolithiasis is probably an under-reported condition of castrated male goats in New Zealand. © 2010 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Vascular calcification is common in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease and is associated with poorer outcomes. Although the pathophysiology is not completely understood, it is clear that it is a multifactorial process involving altered mineral metabolism, as well as changes in systemic and local factors that can promote or inhibit vascular calcification, and all of these are potential therapeutic targets. Current therapy is closely linked to strategies for preventing disordered bone and mineral metabolism in advanced kidney disease and involves lowering the circulating levels of both phosphate and calcium. The efficacy of compounds that specifically target calcification, such as bisphosphonates and thiosulfate, has been shown in animals but only in small numbers of humans, and safety remains an issue. Additional therapies, such as pyrophosphate, vitamin K, and lowering of pH, are supported by animal studies, but are yet to be investigated clinically. As the mineral composition of vascular calcifications is the same as in bone, potential effects on bone must be addressed with any therapy for vascular calcification. © 2010 International Society of Nephrology. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The care of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patient has changed dramatically in the last few years. Potent new antiretroviral drugs combined with updated treatment strategies have now achieved efficient inhibition of HIV replication in most patients. Classes of drugs include both nucleoside and non-nucleoside inhibitors of the viral enzyme reverse transcriptase (RT) and inhibitors of the viral protease and integrase enzymes. As yet immune-based therapies have had little, if any, impact. However, it is clear that the eradication of HIV is not achievable with existing anti-HIV drugs and in spite of the major advances there remains many challenges in the clinical management of HIV-infected individuals. A major drawback of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) is the selection of resistant mutants under suboptimal dosage, in advanced stages of disease or after pretreatment with mono- or double-combination regimens. Monitoring of antiretroviral therapy is achieved by measurement of viral load using nucleic acid amplification techniques. Recommendations for antiretroviral therapy and monitoring are evolving constantly due to the rapid progress in the development of active compounds and new insights into HIV pathogenesis. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - A total of 25 Chinese patients aged 6 to 36 months hospitalised at Beijing Children's Hospital due to melamine-induced kidney stones complicated by acute obstructive renal failure in 2008 were included in a study in order to diagnose and treat these special cases more effectively. Feeding history, clinical presentation, ultrasound findings, treatments and effects were summarised. Twelve to seventeen months follow-up was reported also. Ultrasound examination showed that calculi were located at the kidney and ureters. Stones were composed of both uric acid and melamine in a molar ratio of 1.2:1 to 2.1:1. Treatments providing liquid plus alkalisation of urine proved to be effective in helping the patients pass the stones. Surgical intervention was needed in severe cases. Renal function returned to normal in all 25 patients after various durations of therapy. Sixty-eight percent of the patients expelled all of the calculi within 3 months, 90% in 6 months and 95% in 9 months, without sequelae till now. Melamine-contaminated milk formula can cause kidney stones in infants, which should be diagnosed by feeding history, clinical symptoms and ultrasound examination. Composition of the stones was not only of melamine but also uric acid. Providing liquid orally or intravenously plus alkalisation of urine proved to promote the removal of the stones. Follow-up of 12 to 17 months after discharge showed no sequelae. This record is sourced from MEDLINE®/PubMed®, a database of the U.S. National Library of Medicine

AB  - Repeated use of a toilet results in the build-up of a deposit derived from urine and hard water on the surface of the toilet bowl. The hardened mineral scale is difficult to clean completely, especially in the case of deposits under the rim. A number of studies have focused on kidney stones, which are also caused by urine in the urinary tract; little attention, however, has been paid to the detailed composition and structure of the toilet scale. To develop powerful products for removing the toilet scale effectively instead of relying on acid-cleaning and scrubbing, the composition and the accumulation mechanism of the scale must be clarified. Scale samples collected from the bowl surface were characterized by IR, XRF, XRD, ICP-AES, SEM-EDS and HPLC techniques and found to consist mainly of calcium phosphates, struvite, calcium carbonate, uric acid and proteins. After acid treatment of the scale, a film-like structure of protein, produced as a result of the metabolism of bacteria and mold, was left behind. The scale had composite structures that were composed of the inorganic minerals and the organic materials listed above. This structure might be critical to making the scale resistant to removal by acid-containing cleaners. Copyright © 2009 AOCS. © 2011 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The present study was carried out on cadavers to ascertain the resolving power of C - arm fluoroscopy (mobile) unit. Renal calculi of different sizes were collected from the patients and these calculi were then implanted in the urinary tract of cadavers, at the common sites of impaction. It was seen that calculi as small as 3mm could be identified. However classification of the calculi i.e., prediction of stone composition based on image characteristics was not possible. © 2010 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) works actively to ensure that all the dietary supplements currently in the market are safe for the public. Existing policies are often remodeled and new regulations are developed periodically. A recent change to supplement regulations includes the implementation of a system that allows consumers to contact the FDA or product manufacturer directly to report an adverse reaction as a result of dietary supplement consumption. FDA has employed an adverse event reporting (AER) system that is aimed to police postmarketing effects of dietary supplements. This article will shed light on the importance of tracking serious adverse events with respect to dietary supplements that have already been marketed. Using this data, dietary supplement companies will be able to take the necessary steps to ensure that their products remain safe for the public by removing problematic ingredients from their products and engaging in more effective labeling and product disclaimer practices. © 2010 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.; MEDLINE® is the source for the MeSH terms of this document.

AB  - Background: Laser lithotripsy has been used as an alternative to surgical removal of uroliths. Objective: To describe the procedure and efficacy of laser lithotripsy for removal of lower urinary tract uroliths in horses. Additionally, the ultrastructure and the differences in mineralogy and microstructure from 1 successful and 1 unsuccessful laser lithotripsy case are described. Animals: Six client-owned horses with 7 episodes of naturally occurring urocystoliths, urethroliths, or both. Methods: Retrospective study of all horses treated between 2006 and 2008 by laser lithotripsy. All horses were sedated followed by laser lithotripsy. Quantitative urolith analysis was performed in all cases. Ultrastructure and microstructure analyses were performed on uroliths from 2 horses. Results: Procedural success was achieved in 5 of 7 laser lithotripsy procedures. No complications occurred as a result of laser lithotripsy. One horse developed uroabdomen likely as a result of manual lithotrite disruption of the bladder after failure of laser lithotripsy. There were differences in microstructure between 1 urolith that was successfully fragmented by laser lithotripsy and 1 urolith that was resistant to laser fragmentation. Conclusions and Clinical Importance: Laser lithotripsy is an effective procedure for removal of some urocystoliths, urethroliths, or both in horses. © 2009 by the American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine. © 2009 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.; MEDLINE® is the source for the MeSH terms of this document.

AB  - Structural and microstructural characterizations of eight human kidney stones (KS1-KS8) from eastern India have been carried out using IR spectroscopy, X-ray powder diffraction, scanning electron microscopy and thermogravimetric methods. An X-ray diffraction phase quantification revealed that three of the renal stones (KS1-KS3) were composed exclusively of calcium oxalate monohydrate (COM) and the remaining five (KS4-KS8) contained varying amounts of calcium oxalate dihydrate (40.1-53.0 wt%) and hydroxyapatite (1.3-17.3 wt%), in addition to the COM phase. The crystalline structure of COM (whewellite) at the atomic scale was redetermined through an X-ray powder diffraction study at room temperature using Rietveld analysis. Thermogravimetric analysis of KS1 reveals that COM (whewellite) is stable up to around 439 K, above which temperature anhydrous calcium oxalate is formed. The oxalate transforms to calcium carbonate at 751 K and finally to calcium oxide above 969 K. It should be emphasized that meaningful statistics in total number or gender specificity cannot be achieved with eight kidney stones. © 2009 International Union of Crystallography. © 2011 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - A randomized, placebo-controlled trial was conducted in overweight calcium stone-forming (CSF) patients, to evaluate the effect of calcium supplementation associated with a calorie-restricted diet on body weight (BW) and fat reduction and its potential changes upon serum and urinary parameters. Fifteen patients were placed on a hypocaloric diet for 3 months, supplemented with either calcium carbonate (CaCO<inf>3</inf>, n = 8) or placebo (n = 7), 500 mg bid. Blood and 24-h urine samples were collected and body composition was assessed at baseline and after the intervention. At the end of the study, final BW was significantly lower vs baseline in both CaCO<inf>3</inf> (74 ± 14 vs. 80 ± 14 kg, P = 0.01) and placebo groups (80 ± 10 vs. 87 ± 9 kg, P = 0.02) but the mean percentage of loss of body weight and body fat did not differ between CaCO<inf>3</inf> and placebo (7.0 ± 2.0 vs. 8.0 ± 3.0%, P = 0.40 and 13.0 ± 7.0 vs. 13.0 ± 10.0%; P = 0.81, respectively). After CaCO<inf>3</inf> or placebo, no significant differences versus baseline were observed for urinary parameters in both CaCO<inf>3</inf> and placebo, except for a higher mean urinary citrate in placebo group. These data suggest that increasing calcium intake by calcium carbonate supplementation did not contribute to a further reduction of BW and fat in overweight CSF patients submitted to a hypocaloric diet nor altered urinary lithogenic parameters. © 2009 Springer-Verlag. © 2009 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.; MEDLINE® is the source for the MeSH terms of this document.

AB  - Objective: The composition of urinary stones in children depends on socioeconomic conditions, geography and dietary habits. Pediatric urolithiasis remains endemic in developing countries. The aim of this study was to analyze stone composition in an Egyptian patient population. Patients and methods: We analyzed prospectively urinary stones from 100 consecutive children (73 males, 27 females), aged 14 months to 12 years. The stones were located in the upper urinary tract in 78%, lower urinary tract in 19% and both in 3%. Male patients had more lower urinary tract stones. On presentation 67% had flank pain and 37% had hematuria. Stones were treated by open surgery in 69% of patients, shockwave lithotripsy in 20% and endoscopic extraction in 13%. Results: The components of the upper urinary tract calculi were calcium oxalate (47%), ammonium acid urate (26%) and calcium carbonate (21%), whereas the main components of the lower urinary tract calculi were ammonium acid urate (27.2%), struvite (27.2%) and calcium carbonate (22.7%). Urinary tract infection was involved in the development of one third of the stones. Endemic stones were present in 17% of patients, and stones of metabolic origin in 15%. The etiology of stone formation remained unknown in one third of patients. Conclusion: The epidemiological profile of urinary stones in Egyptian children can now be considered intermediate between developing countries where dietary deficiencies are the main causes and developed countries where infectious and metabolic calculi are observed. © 2008 Journal of Pediatric Urology Company. © 2009 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.; MEDLINE® is the source for the MeSH terms of this document.

AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the scientific evidence on the safety and efficacy of Essiac. This review serves as a clinical support tool. Electronic searches were conducted in 10 databases, 20 additional journals (not indexed in common databases), and bibliographies from 50 selected secondary references. No restrictions were placed on the language or quality of the publications. Standardized inclusion and exclusion criteria were used for selection. A review of the literature on Essiac and essiac formulations showed a lack of high-quality clinical trials to substantiate any of Essiac's traditional uses. Weak evidence from preclinical, animal, and laboratory data warranted a discussion regarding Essiac's use for cancer, but the results are inconclusive. Several other essiac preparations are noted in the literature, adding confusion to the exact formula and its proposed benefits. In general, there is a lack of both safety and efficacy data for Essiac and essiac formulations. Well-designed trials testing Essiac or individual herbal components are necessary to make firm recommendations. © 2009 BC Decker Inc. © 2010 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Renal tubular acidosis are forms of metabolic acidosis characterized by an impairment of urinary acidification due to a lack of urine excretion of protons or loss of bicarbonates. Primary distal renal acidosis (dRTA) is characterized by hyperchlorernic metabolic acidosis due to failure in proton excretion, variably severe nephrocalcinosis and/or nephrolithiasis associated with hypercalciuria and hypocitraturia. When the metabolic acidosis is compensated, dRTA can be diagnosed by the failure of urinary acidification after oral ammonium chloride or furosemide administration. dRTA is inherited as either an autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive trait An autosomal dominant form results from a SLC4A1 gene mutation leading to dysfunction of the anionic exchanger type 1 (AE1). Otherwise, recessive forms are due to mutations of ATP6V1B1 gene encoding the B1-subunit of H+-ATPase expressed in the apical membrane of the a intercalated cells in collecting duct and in the cochlea. Those mutations lead to dRTA accompanied by sensorineural deafness. Also, mutations in ATP6V0A4 gene encode the accessory subunit a4 of the H +ATPase, leading to recessive forms of dRTA with preserved hearing or delayed signs of deafness. Molecular approach can identify mutations which are responsible for this pathology. The medical treatment is simple and involves an alkali load which allows curing the metabolic acidosis. Long-term outcome is usually good unless the patient's compliance is low or alkalizing treatment is insufficient. © 2010 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Aim:To observe the efficacy and safety of Rocaltrol (calcitriol) and/or Caltrate D (calicum carbonate plus vitamin D) in elderly Chinese women with osteopenia or osteoporosis.Methods:One hundred fifty Chinese women aged over 65 years with osteopenia or osteoporosis from three centers were randomly divided into two groups. Seventy-six participants received Caltrate D as one pill daily; the other 74 participants received 0.25 g Caltrate D plus Rocaltrol daily. The changes in bone mineral density (BMD) served as primary end-points. Height changes, the presence of new vertebral fractures, muscle strength and balance were evaluated.Results:The following are the mean percentage changes (and SD) in BMD over 12 months: at L2-L4, 0.833.88 in the Caltrate D group and 2.844.04 in the RocaltrolCaltrate D group (P=0.003, by ANCOVA); at the femoral neck, 0.043.94 in the Caltrate D group and 2.015.45 in the RocaltrolCaltrate D group (P=0.085, by ANCOVA); and in the trochanter, 1.594.57 in the Caltrate D group and 3.766.25 in the RocaltrolCaltrate D group (P=0.053, by ANCOVA). The stand and maximal forward reach test (SMFRT) was significantly enhanced in both groups during the 12 months of treatment, but no significant differences were found between these two groups. No severe adverse event related to these medications occurred throughout the study.Conclusion:Treatment with Rocaltrol plus Caltrate D or Caltrate D for 12 months in elderly Chinese postmenopausal women effectively increased BMD at the lumbar spine. Rocaltrol plus Caltrate D was more effective at the lumbar spine than Caltrate D alone. © 2009 CPS and SIMM. © 2009 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Melamine is an industrial chemical used primarily as plastics stabilizer and fire retardant. On September 11, 2008, melamine-contaminated milk products were reported to be responsible for urinary tract calculi in infants and children in China. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence, lesions, risk factors, clinical features, and management of children fed with the melamine-contaminated milk products. Methods: A total of 15 577 infants and children fed with the milk products were screened at our hospital. Ultrasonography was performed in all the infants and children. For those found with urinary tract calculion ultrasonography, urnalysis was done. Among them, 846 with detailed data screened from September 17 to 25 were enrolled for further analysis in this study. They were divided into calculus group (326 children) and non-calculus group (520 children) according to the results of ultrasonography. They included 429 boys and 417 girls, aged from 1 month to 5 years (median, 18 months). Their clinical and laboratory data, ultrasonograms, and treatment results were analyzed. Results: Of the 15 577 children screened, 562 (3.61%) had urinary tract calculi. The rate was closely related to the melamine concentration in patients fed with formula. In 846 children with detailed data enrolled in this analysis, weight and head circumference Z scores in the calculus group were lower than those in the non-calculus group (P=0.048, P=0.046). Long duration of formula feeding, high melamine contained formula, and minimal water intake were the risk factors for calculi (P<0.05, respectively). Of 326 children with calculi, 281 had small calculiless than 0.5 cm in diameter, 227 had multiple calculi, and 34 had urinary tract distention. Moreover, diffuse renal lesions, renal failure and ascites were noted in 4, 3 and 2 patients, respectively. After 1-month treatment with sodium bicarbonate and Chinese traditional medicine, calculi disappeared in 49 of 54 outpatients. In 41 inpatients, 5 had calculi removed operatively and 36 had calculi minimized. Conclusions: Melamine-contaminated milk products induced urinary tract calculi, which have a good response to conservative therapy. Long-term follow-up of infants and children fed with melamine-contaminated milk products is required, and food safety should be supervised increasingly for the health of children. © Springer 2009. © 2009 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.; MEDLINE® is the source for the MeSH terms of this document.

AB  - Objective-To determine the mineral composition of calculi, anatomic locations of the calculi, and findings of urinalysis and bacteriologic culture of urine and calculi in guinea pigs with urolithiasis. Design-Cross-sectional study. Animals-127 guinea pigs. Procedures-Records of urinary calculi that had been submitted to the University of California Stone Laboratory from 1985 through 2003 were reviewed. In addition, submissions of urinary calculi for evaluation by the laboratory were prospectively solicited from 2004 through 2007. Prospectively obtained calculi were accompanied by a urine sample for urinalysis and bacteriologic culture and a completed questionnaire. All calculi were analyzed by use of polarized light microscopy and infrared spectroscopy. A subset of calculi was examined by means of x-ray diffractometry (XRD). Results-83% (43/52) of calculi from the laboratory database and 93% (70/75) of calculi that were prospectively solicited were composed of 100% calcium carbonate. Analysis via XRD confirmed that 5 of 6 calculi from a subset that had the greatest gross morphologic variation were composed of 100% calcite. Although many guinea pigs had received antimicrobials before bacteriologic cultures of urine were performed, Corynebacterium renale was isolated from 5 urine samples. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance-Contrary to findings of other studies, urinary calculi analyzed for the present study were most commonly composed of 100% calcium carbonate, and infrared spectroscopy or XRD was necessary to differentiate this mineral from others. Treatments, including diet and husbandry practices, should be developed to help prevent development of calcium carbonate calculi in guinea pigs. © 2012 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.; MEDLINE® is the source for the MeSH terms of this document.

AB  - Archaeological records from ancient Egypt, Babylonia, and China show that infection stones have afflicted humans for millennia. In the early 19th century, the chemical composition of infection stones was elucidated as Magnesium Ammonium Phosphate (MgNH4PO4.6H2O). They are also called struvite (named after the Russian naturalist, Baron von Struve), infection-induced, phosphatic and triple phosphate stones in the medical literature. Struvite calculi often coexist with calcium carbonate apatite crystals (Ca10(PO4)6.CO3) due to their shared propensity for forming in alkaline urine. Struvite/Calcium carbonate apatite crystals in the urinary tract commonly aggregate and grow to form large, branched stones called staghorns. Indeed, they account for approximately 75% of staghorns, whereas uric acid, cystine, and calcium oxalate or phosphate calculi account for the remaining 25%.(1) Although struvite calculi represent less than 10% of urolithiasis cases in North America, their potential for morbidity and mortality make them important for physicians to recognize and treat expeditiously.(2) Firstly, untreated infection stones are capable of rapidly growing to fill all the calyces in the kidney (staghorn) and causing progressive renal demise. This was illustrated by a study that analyzed 1, 391 consecutive patients started on hemodialysis between 1989 and 2000 at the Necker Hospital in Paris.(3) 3.2% of the patients required hemodialysis as a result of chronic nephrolithiasis, with a disproportionate number (42%) occurring in patients with a history of recurrent struvite calculi. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Introduction. By means of an X-ray diffractometer, it is possible to very precisely determine the composition of examined stones while identifying each kind of crystal. The objective of this paper is to make an in vitro assessment of the crystalline composition of urinary stones obtained during surgeries or those spontaneously excreted by the patients treated in the I and II Clinic of Urology of the Medical University in Łódź. Material and method. The research was conducted with the use of X-ray diffractometers: Dron - 1 or D 5000 Siemens. One hundred eighty-eight urinary stones obtained from patients treated in the clinics were examined. Results. The following crystals were found in the examined urinary stones: whewellite occurs in 97 (51.6%) stones, weddellite in 45 (23.9%), struvite in 82 (43.6%), apatite in 70 (37.2%), newberyite in 40 (21.2%), brushite in 34 (18.1%), bobierrite in 14 (7.4%), vitlokite in 7 (3.7%), uric acid in 12 (6.4%), ammonium acid urate in 1 (0.5%), calcium carbonate in 3 (1.6%), cystine and other sporadically occurring crystals were found in 0.6% to 1% of cases. Stones made of pure calcium oxalate constituted 18.1%. Oxalic stones with the additive of other crystals, although not containing any struvite, were found in 20.2% of cases, which in total makes 38% of the analyzed stones. Pure struvite stones constituted 5.3% and the ones with the additive of other phosphate crystals - 27.7%, which makes 33.0% in total. Uric acid stones constituted 5.3%, whereas with the additive of other crystals - 1.1%, which makes 6.4% in total. Cystine stones were found in 0.6% of cases. Mixed stones containing all kinds of crystals constituted 22.0%. Conclusions. Diffractometric studies allow very precise determination of the composition of urinary stones. While using the crystalline structure as a criterion for dividing urinary stones, one cannot create any homogenous groups. On the basis of the conducted research, we divided urinary stones into oxalic, phosphate, uric acid, cystine, and mixed ones, the latter containing all possible kinds of crystals. The largest group is made of mixed stones, which constitute 55% of the deposits and combine infected stones without calcium oxalate and stones that are a mixture of struvite and calcium oxalate as well as other crystals. Another numerous group is made of oxalic stones - 38.3% of cases. Uric acid stones (6.4%) and cystine stones (0.6%) are less frequent. Based on the observations conducted it can be concluded that along with the increase in the number of crystals containedin a uric stone, the number of uric acid deposits decreases and the number of stones made of phosphate and mixed oxalic and phosphate crystals, often with the additive of struvite, grows. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Patients with ileostomy typically have recurrent renal stones and produce scanty, acidic, sodium-poor urine because of abnormally large enteric losses of water and sodium bicarbonate. Here we used a combination of intra-operative digital photography and biopsy of the renal papilla and cortex to measure changes associated with stone formation in seven patients with ileostomy. Papillary deformity was present in four patients and was associated with decreased estimated glomerular filtration rates. All patients had interstitial apatite plaque, as predicted from their generally acid, low-volume urine. Two patients had stones attached to plaque; however, all patients had crystal deposits that plugged the ducts of Bellini and inner medullary collecting ducts (IMCDs). Despite acid urine, all crystal deposits contained apatite, and five patients had deposits of sodium and ammonium acid urates. Stones were either uric acid or calcium oxalate as predicted by supersaturation, however, there was a general lack of supersaturation for calcium phosphate as brushite, sodium, or ammonium acid urate because of the overall low urine pH. This suggests that local tubular pH exceeds that of bulk urine. Despite low urine pH, patients with an ileostomy resemble those with obesity bypass, in whom IMCD apatite crystal plugs are found. They are, however, unlike these bypass patients in having interstitial apatite plaque. IMCD plugging with sodium and ammonium acid urate has not been found previously and appears to correlate with formation of uric acid stones. © 2009 International Society of Nephrology. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Vitamin D and related compounds have been used to prevent osteoporotic fractures in older people. Objectives: To determine the effects of vitamin D or related compounds, with or without calcium, for preventing fractures in older people. Search strategy: We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library 2007, Issue 3), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and reference lists of articles. Most recent search: October 2007. Selection criteria: Randomised or quasi-randomised trials comparing vitamin D or related compounds, alone or with calcium, against placebo, no intervention, or calcium alone, reporting fracture outcomes in older people. Data collection and analysis: Two authors independently assessed trial quality, and extracted data. Data were pooled, where admissible, using the fixed-effect model, or random-effects model if heterogeneity between studies appeared high. Main results: Forty-five trials were included. Vitamin D alone appears unlikely to be effective in preventing hip fracture (nine trials, 24,749 participants, RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.33), vertebral fracture (five trials, 9138 participants, RR 0.90, 95%CI 0.42 to 1.92) or any new fracture (10 trials, 25,016 participants, RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.09). Vitamin D with calcium reduces hip fractures (eight trials, 46,658 participants, RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.73 to 0.96). Although subgroup analysis by residential status showed a significant reduction in hip fractures in people in institutional care, the difference between this and the community-dwelling subgroup was not significant (P = 0.15). Overall hypercalcaemia is significantly more common in people receiving vitamin D or an analogue, with or without calcium (18 trials, 11,346 participants, RR 2.35, 95% CI 1.59 to 3.47); this is especially true of calcitriol (four trials, 988 participants, RR 4.41, 95% CI 2.14 to 9.09). There is a modest increase in gastrointestinal symptoms (11 trials, 47,042 participants, RR 1.04, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.08, P = 0.04) and a small but significant increase in renal disease (11 trials, 46,537 participants, RR 1.16, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.33). Authors' conclusions: Frail older people confined to institutions may sustain fewer hip fractures if given vitamin D with calcium. Vitamin D alone is unlikely to prevent fracture. Overall there is a small but significant increase in gastrointestinal symptoms and renal disease associated with vitamin D or its analogues. Calcitriol is associated with an increased incidence of hypercalcaemia. Copyright © 2009 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Renal disease is commonly encountered by primary care physicians during their day-to-day visits with patients. Common renal disorders include hypertension, proteinuria, kidney stones, and chronic kidney disease. Despite their prevalence, many physicians may be unfamiliar with the diagnosis and initial treatment of these common renal disorders. Early recognition and intervention are important in slowing the progression of chronic kidney disease and preventing its complications. The evidence-based pearls in this article will help primary care physicians avoid common pitfalls in the recognition and treatment of such disorders and guide their decision to refer their patients to a specialist. © 2009 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Equine urolithiasis is seldom diagnosed and sometimes only accidentally or post mortem. However, the considerably higher incidence of "sabulous" material (7%) indicates that certain urinary excreted substances exceed their solubility more often than assumed. The typical equine urolith consists of calcium carbonate. The urine is already supersaturated with calcium under physiological conditions due to the poorly regulated intestinal absorption compared with other species and the efficient renal elimination of a calcium excess. Moreover, additional factors such as a lack of urine stabilizing components and the existence of a seed crystal are necessary in order to form a calculus. It could be shown that also a correct feed ration with typical hay from grassland or pasture alone is enough to meet and even exceed the nutritional requirements concerning calcium of an adult horse of 600 kg (except for lactation) . Therefore, it is necessary not only to analyse the roughage but also to scrutinise calcium-containing compound feed in order to avoid an oversupply and hence to minimize the risk of concretions of urinary crystals. © Schlütersche Verlagsgesellschaft mbH & Co.

AB  - Knowledge of the mineral composition of uroliths in various species of animals can help veterinarians predict the mineral composition of stones in vivo. This information is important because dissolution of existing uroliths, or minimizing further growth of uroliths in situ, is dependent on knowledge of the mineral composition of uroliths. With this objective in mind, this report summarizes the results of quantitative mineral analysis of uroliths retrieved from 4468 animals sent to the Minnesota Urolith Center. It also encompasses the most extensive database about uroliths from animals other than domesticated dogs and cats found in the literature. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Azatanavir is a protease inhibitor (PI) approved for the treatment of HIV-1 infection. Atazanavir is a substrate and inhibitor of cytochrome P450 isozyme 3A and an inhibitor and inducer of P-glycoprotein. It has similar virologic efficacy as efavirenz and ritonavir-boosted lopinavir in antiretroviral-naive individuals. Its impact on lipids is less than other Pls and it is suitable for those in whom hyperlipidemia is undesirable. Ritonavir boosting of atazanavir enhances the bioavailability of atazanavir but may result in some elevation of lipids and is recommended for treatment-experienced patients and those receiving efavirenz or tenofovir. Ritonavir-boosted atazanavir has similar antiviral activity as ritonavir-boosted lopinavir in both antiretroviral therapy-naive and -experienced patients. Atazanavir causes unconjugated bilirubinemia in over 40% of patients but results in less than 2% discontinuations. Atazanavir is licensed for once-daily use and atazanavir/ritonavir competes with lopinavir/ritonavir as the most commonly prescribed PI. © 2008 Expert Reviews Ltd. © 2009 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Objective: To compare biochemical variables, renal function and calcium and vitamin D intakes in euparathyroid and hyperparathyroid patients with primary osteoporosis and osteopenia and describe the measures necessary to normalize serum PTH in the patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism. Design and patients: We reviewed the charts of normocalcemic patients with primary osteoporosis and osteopenia first seen during the years 1991-2003 and identified 75 with elevated serum PTH levels at baseline. These patients were compared to all the 143 euparathyroid patients first seen in 1998 and 1999. Patients were restudied after 1 year and we attempted to follow patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism until PTH levels became normal. Measurements: At baseline serum PTH, ionized calcium, inorganic phosphate, alkaline phosphatase, creatinine, a complete blood count and serum 25 hydroxy vitamin D were measured in the early morning fasting state. These tests were repeated at follow up. Results: In one-third of the hyperparathyroid patients, the standard baseline treatment failed to correct the secondary hyperparathyroidism necessitating extraordinary measures including unusually large doses of vitamin D (i.e. 50 000 IU vitamin D<inf>2</inf> twice weekly) or the substitution of calcium citrate for calcium carbonate as a calcium supplement. Conclusion: Large doses of vitamin D are frequently necessary to suppress secondary hyperparathyroidism in patients with primary osteoporosis and osteopenia. This suggests that vitamin D metabolism may be altered in some of these patients. © 2008 The Authors. © 2009 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.; MEDLINE® is the source for the MeSH terms of this document.

AB  - Since the introduction of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) in 1942, the availability of scientific information regarding the physiologic action of estrogen alone and in combination with progesterone has grown substantially. The specific physiology of changes in endogenous estrogen as a causal factor in bone loss that occurs as the result of menopause is now better understood. Accumulating evidence regarding the benefit of estrogen in protecting against bone loss at the time of menopause made it the first choice for prevention and treatment of osteoporosis, until the findings of the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) were announced in 2002. Fortunately, the availability of multiple alternative agents for prevention and treatment of osteoporosis in menopausal women has provided clinicians with other options. There remain a small number of patients who cannot tolerate or afford these alternative therapies. Recent publications resulting from the WHI should be understood by practicing physicians who are faced with this dilemma and may need to consider HRT in treating patients with osteoporosis. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2008. © 2012 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Familial hypomagnesemia with hypercalciuria and nephrocalcinosis (FHHNC) is a rare autosomal recessive tubular disorder characterized by excessive renal magnesium and calcium wasting, eventually, progressing to renal failure. It has been recently attributed to a mutation in the Claudin 16 (CLDN 16) gene of the Paracellin-1 (PCLN-1) tight junction protein. Herein, we report 2 sisters with FHHNC. Both sisters presented at an early stage with hypomagnesemia and hypocalcemia. The first patient was initially mislabeled and treated as a case of hypoparathyroidism, while the second patient was diagnosed retrospectively after the diagnosis of her sister. The 2 patients developed end stage renal disease. © 2008 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Primary hyperparathyroidism is a disease caused by exaggerated secretion of the parathyroid gland hormone, produced by an adenoma in 80% of cases. Ectopic adenomas occur in a small proportion of cases. Herein, the authors report a 72-year-old woman with a delayed diagnosis of primary hyperparathyroidism, produced by an intrathoracic adenoma, with a longstanding course, presenting with severe osteoporosis, multiple fractures, bone deformities, and neurologic impairments. Persistent hypercalcemia, high levels of alkaline phosphatase, and parathyroid hormone were documented and a paratracheal mass was found on a helicoidal tomography of the thorax. After surgical removal, the histopathological examination confirmed an ectopic adenoma of the parathyroid gland and the patient achieved some improvement in her clinical picture. © 2008 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins. © 2009 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Introduction: No information is available on the long-term adherence to calcium with vitamin D in women in a general medical practice. Materials and Methods: We assessed in 412 postmenopausal women factors associated with adherence and reasons for nonadherence to supplemental calcium with vitamin D tablets after a counseling session. Results: Approximately 49% adherence was achieved in all of the sampled subjects during a 10-year period and 37% in subjects with intention-to-treat.Those followed for the entire 10 years had a 46% adherence. Forgetting to take supplements, perceiving supplements as unimportant, not recalling the counseling session, and gastrointestinal intoler ance constituted the set of major reasons for nonadherence. Postmenopausal women with previous fractures, higher socioeconomic groups, musculoskeletal disorders, and receiving current or past glucocorticoid therapy were significantly more adherent than women without such characteristics. Conclusion: Long-term adherence to supplemental calcium with vitamin D after counseling was slightly different than the adherence with prescription items after counseling. Symptomatic conditions are associated with higher adherence. © 2008 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Background. Japanese encephalitis (JE) is the most important mosquito-borne viral encephalitis and has a high case fatality rate. It is caused by Japanese encephalitis virus. Improved vaccines are urgently needed for residents in countries of endemicity, travelers, and the military. The aim of the present trial was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of IC51, Intercell's Vero cell-derived, purified, inactivated JE vaccine. Methods. This was a randomized (3:1), double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter phase 3 trial. Healthy subjects were randomized to receive 2 doses of IC51 (n = 2012) or placebo (n = 663) at a 4-week interval. Adverse events following immunization (AEFI) were documented over a period of 2 months. Results. The rate of severe AEFI was similar in the IC51 group (0.5%) and the placebo group (0.9%). The rate of medically attended AEFI and all AEFI was also similar in the IC51 group and the placebo group. The same applied for all adverse events, including local and systemic tolerability. Importantly, there were no signs of acute allergic reactions. Conclusion. The Intercell JE vaccine IC51 had a safety profile similar to that of placebo. These data, together with the immunogenicity data from a recent phase 3 trial, form the basis of application for licensure of this vaccine. Trial registration.

AB  - X-ray powder diffraction was used to study the phase composition of human renal calculi. The stones were collected from 56 donors in Vitória, Espírito Santo state, southeastern Brazil. An XRD phase quantification revealed that 61% of the studied renal stones were composed exclusively of calcium oxalate [34% formed only by calcium oxalate monohydrate (COM) and 27% presents both monohydrate and dihydratate calcium oxalate]. The 39% multi-composed calculi have various other phases such as uric acid and calcium phosphate. Rietveld refinement of XRD data of one apparent monophasic (COM) renal calculus revealed the presence of a small amount of hydroxyapatite. The presence of this second phase and the morphology of the stone (ellipsoidal) indicated that this calculus can be classified as non-papillary type and its nucleation process developed in closed kidney cavities. In order to show some advantages of the X-ray powder diffraction technique, a study of the phase transformation of monohydrate calcium oxalate into calcium carbonate (CaCO <inf>3</inf>) was carried out by annealing of a monophasic COM calculi at 200, 300, and 400 °C for 48 h in a N2 gas atmosphere. The results of the XRD for the heat treated samples is in good agreement with the thermogravimetric analysis found in the literature and shows that X-ray powder diffraction can be used as a suitable technique to study the composition and phase diagram of renal calculi. © 2008 International Centre for Diffraction Data. © 2013 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Objective: To prospectively assess the clinical efficacy and safety of lower-pole fluoroscopically guided percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PNL). Methods: A total of 90 renal units in 87 patients underwent lower-pole fluoroscopically guided PNL for renal calculi. The average patient age was 56.0 years. Staghorn calculi were present in 41 renal units. There were 22 were upper pole, 54 middle pole, 76 lower pole, 70 pelvic and 18 ureteropelvic junction calculi. Patients without significant residual fragments greater than 3mm on postoperative day 2 were defined as primarily successful. Significant residual fragments were treated with shock wave lithotripsy (SWL) every other day from postoperative day 3. Results: Mean operative time was 129.5 min (SD, 49.0). Blood transfusion was required in four patients. Septic shock developed in three patients. Sixty-three percent of the patients (57 of 90 procedures) were primarily successful after PNL: 83.7% of non-staghorn patients (41 of 49 procedures) and 39.0% of staghorn patients (16 of 41 procedures). Of the 33 patients with significant residual fragments, 13 staghorn and six non-staghorn patients had residual fragments in their middle calyces. Of the preoperative variables, staghorn calculus and calculus in the middle calyx were significant predictors of significant residual fragments after PNL. After adjunctive SWL, the overall success rate was 94.5%. Conclusions: Our study suggests that lower-pole fluoroscopically guided PNL is a safe and effective therapy for patients with staghorn or non-staghorn calculi. In patients with staghorn calculi or calculi in the middle calyx, adjunctive treatment is sometimes required to treat significant residual fragments. © 2008 The Japanese Urological Association. © 2008 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.; MEDLINE® is the source for the MeSH terms of this document.

AB  - Although significant progress has been made during the last 3 decades in the minimally invasive surgical management of stone disease, the medical prevention of urolithiasis still remains challenging as much less progress has been achieved during the same time period. The purpose of this article is to provide the practicing urologist with practical guidelines for the metabolic evaluation and management of the recurrent stone patient. The recommendations are based on the latest available information regarding the pathogenesis, medical treatment options, and decision-making rationale when managing these challenging patients. © 2009 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.; MEDLINE® is the source for the MeSH terms of this document.

AB  - Recent evidence suggests a role for nanobacteria in a growing number of human diseases, including renal stone formation, cardiovascular diseases, and cancer. This large body of research studies promotes the view that nanobacteria are not only alive but that they are associated with disease pathogenesis. However, it is still unclear whether they represent novel life forms, overlooked nanometer-size bacteria, or some other primitive self-replicating microorganisms. Here, we report that CaCO<inf>3</inf> precipitates prepared in vitro are remarkably similar to purported nanobacteria in terms of their uniformly sized, membrane-delineated vesicular shapes, with cellular division-like formations and aggregations in the form of colonies. The gradual appearance of nanobacteria-like particles in incubated human serum as well as the changes seen with their size and shape can be influenced and explained by introducing varying levels of CO<inf>2</inf> and NaHCO<inf>3</inf> as well as other conditions known to influence the precipitation of CaCO<inf>3</inf>. Western blotting reveals that the monoclonal antibodies, claimed to be specific for nanobacteria, react in fact with serum albumin. Furthermore, nanobacteria-like particles obtained from human blood are able to withstand high doses of γ-irradiation up to 30 kGy, and no bacterial DNA is found by performing broad-range PCR amplifications. Collectively, our results provide a more plausible abiotic explanation for the unusual properties of purported nanobacteria. © 2008 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Artifacts such as surgical clips, gallstones, and kidney stones are often present in the soft tissue stripe lateral to vertebral bodies. Using cadaveric specimens, we placed bra wires, gallbladder clips, a large gallstone, a calcium carbonate or a calcium citrate pill lateral to L1, or a large or small calcium-containing kidney stone lateral to L3 and compared the mean bone mineral density (BMD) of individual vertebral bodies and L1-L4 with and without the soft tissue artifact. The specimens used had high BMD (L1-L4 BMD = 1.049 g/cm2) and low BMD (L1-L4 BMD = 0.669 g/cm2) and were scanned with a Hologic Discovery W scanner with 12.7 software in the array mode. None of the artifacts affected L1 or L3 BMD or L1-L4 BMD significantly in the high BMD spine. However, bra wires, a large calcium citrate pill lateral to L1, 3 calcium citrate pills lateral to L1, a calcium carbonate pill over L1, and 3 calcium carbonate pills lateral to L1 did affect L1-L4 BMD in low BMD torso. Gallbladder clips or gallstone did not affect L1-L4 BMD in either specimen. We conclude that artifacts lateral to the spine, particularly in a low BMD spine, can affect the interpretation of L1-L4 BMD using a Hologic Discovery W scanner with 12.7 software in array mode. © 2008 The International Society for Clinical Densitometry. © 2008 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.; MEDLINE® is the source for the MeSH terms of this document.

AB  - Pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE) is a genetic disorder in which elastic fibers become calcified with prominent cutaneous, ocular, and cardiovascular features. Calcinosis cutis is an acquired disorder of calcium deposition in cutaneous tissues that occurs as one of the following forms: dystrophic, metastatic, idiopathic, and iatrogenic. We report a case of a woman with PXE who developed widespread dystrophic calcinosis cutis in areas affected by PXE. Although tumoral calcification and nephrolithiasis have been reported in patients with PXE, only one other case in the English-language literature of PXE and calcinosis cutis has been reported and this case was characterized by small, milia-like papules on the front of the neck, without significant discomfort, whereas our patient had widespread involvement that was very painful and pruritic. On 6-month follow-up, this patient had only mild improvement after treatment with an anti-itch lotion and aluminum hydroxide, with which she was noncompliant. © 2008 American Academy of Dermatology, Inc. © 2008 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.; MEDLINE® is the source for the MeSH terms of this document.

AB  - Kidney stones are one of the most common chronic disorders in industrialized countries. In patients with kidney stones, the goal of medical therapy is to prevent the formation of new kidney stones and to reduce growth of existing stones. The evaluation of the patient with kidney stones should identify dietary, environmental, and genetic factors that contribute to stone risk. Radiologic studies are required to identify the stone burden at the time of the initial evaluation and to follow up the patient over time to monitor success of the treatment program. For patients with a single stone an abbreviated laboratory evaluation to identify systemic disorders usually is sufficient. For patients with multiple kidney stones 24-hour urine chemistries need to be measured to identify abnormalities that predispose to kidney stones, which guides dietary and pharmacologic therapy to prevent future stone events. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Diagnostic tools and treatment options for epilepsy have expanded in recent years. Imaging techniques once confined to research laboratories are now routinely used for clinical purposes. Medications that were unavailable a few years ago are now first-line agents. Patients with refractory seizures push for earlier surgical intervention, consider treatment with medical devices, and actively seek nonpharmacologic alternatives. We review some of these recent advances in the management of epilepsy. Copyright © 2008 by Annual Reviews.

AB  - Objective: To compare the efficacy and safety of adding ossein-hydroxyapatite compound (OHC) or calcium carbonate (CC) to raloxifene (RLX) therapy for controlling bone loss in postmenopausal women. Design: Ninety postmenopausal women were assigned to treatment with RLX plus OHC (group 1, 48 women) or RLX plus CC (group 2, 42 women) for up to 3 years in an open-label, comparative study. Ultrasound measurement of amplitude-dependent speed of sound (ADSoS) was used to evaluate mean changes in bone mineral density. The primary endpoint was mean change of ADSoS from baseline. An intention to treat and per protocol analysis were carried out. Adverse effects were also recorded. Results: Over the study period, the mean ADSoS diminished in both groups even though the rate of reduction was higher in the RLX plus CC group, with a mean change in ADSoS score of -18.72 m/s from baseline to year 3 in the RLX plus OHC group and -63.64 m/s in the RLX+CC group (P = 0.006). Similar results were seen on T and Z scores. Adverse effects were infrequent and the number and type were similar between groups. Conclusions: RLX plus OHC appears to be more effective in controlling bone loss than RLX plus CC for the control of bone loss in postmenopausal women. © 2008 by The North American Menopause Society. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - (Purpose) It gives important information in selecting the appropriate treatment for urolithiasis to confirm the component of urinary calculus. Presently component analysis of the urinary calculus is generally performed by infrared spectroscopy which is employed by companies providing laboratory testing services in Japan. The infrared spectroscopy determines the molecular components from the absorption spectra in consequence of atomic vibrations. It has the drawback that an accurate crystal structure cannot be analyzed compared with the X-ray diffraction method which analyzes the crystal constituent based on the diffraction of X-rays on crystal lattice. The components of the urinary calculus including carbonate are carbonate apatite and calcium carbonate such as calcite. Although the latter is reported to be very rare component in human urinary calculus, the results by infrared spectroscopy often show that calcium carbonate is included in calculus. The infrared spectroscopy can confirm the existence of carbonate but cannot determine whether carbonate is originated from carbonate apatite or calcium carbonate. Thus, it is not clear whether calcium carbonate is included in human urinary calculus component in Japan. In this study, we examined human urinary calculus including carbonate by use of X-ray structural analysis in order to elucidate the origin of carbonate in human urinary calculus. (Materials and methods) We examined 17 human calculi which were reported to contain calcium carbonate by infrared spectroscopy performed in the clinical laboratory. Fifteen calculi were obtained from urinary tract, and two were from gall bladder. The stones were analyzed by X-ray powder method after crushed finely. (Results) The reports from the clinical laboratory showed that all urinary culculi consisted of calcium carbonate and calcium phosphate, while the gallstones consisted of calcium carbonate. But the components of all urinary calculi were revealed to be carbonate apatite by X-ray diffraction. The components of gallstones were shown to be calcium carbonate (one calcite and the other aragonite) not only by infrared spectroscopy but by X-ray diffraction. (Conclusions) It was shown that component analysis of the calculus could be more accurately performed by adding X-ray diffraction method to infrared spectroscopy. It was shown that calcium carbonate existed in a gallstone. As for the carbonate in human urinary calculi, present study showed that it was not calcium carbonate origin but carbonate apatite origin. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Two West Indian manatees (Trichechus manatus spp.) were reported with severe emaciation. One animal was a Florida manatee from the Everglades; the other was an Antillean manatee from Cuba. On necropsy, both animals had nephrolithiasis, pyelonephritis, and moderate to severe renomegaly. Histopathology revealed multifocal to diffuse pyelonephritis, interstitial nephritis, and nephrocalcinosis. The stones were analyzed and consisted primarily of calcium carbonate. Serum chemistry values for the Florida animal revealed no renal abnormalities. The mechanism of calculus formation remains unclear in manatees. In horses, another hindgut fermenter, the most common urolith is also calcium carbonate. Urinalyses performed on manatees are very similar to those of horses (i.e., alkaline urine, low specific gravity, and calcium carbonate crystals). Formation of uroliths in manatees may have a pathogenesis similar to equine urolithiasis. © Wildlife Disease Association 2008. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Osteoporosis poses a significant public health issue, causing significant morbidity and mortality. Calcium and vitamin D utilization in the optimization of bone health is often overlooked by patients and health care providers. In addition, the optimal standard of care for osteoporosis should encompass adequate calcium and vitamin D intake. Dietary intake or supplementation with calcium and vitamin D will be reviewed, including recent recommendations for increased vitamin D intake. Compliance to calcimn and vitamin D therapy is paramount for effective prevention of osteoporotic fractures. A recently released algorithm (FRAX) estimating absolute fracture risk allows the health care provider to decide when pharmacologic therapy is warranted in addition to calcium and vitamin D. When pharmacologic therapy is advised, continued use of calcium and vitamin D is recommended for optimal fracture risk reduction. A 'bricks and mortar' analogy is often helpful when counseling patients and this analogy will be explained. This manuscript reviews relevant data related to calcium and vitamin D use for patients at risk for fracture due to bone loss. © 2008 Sunyecz, publisher and licensee Dove Medical Press Ltd. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Urinary stone diseases are increasing in the Middle East. The majority of urinary stone cases are found in the northern part of the country. Stone samples taken from patients living in the Irbid area were collected from Princess Basma Hospital. The present study concentrates on the mineralogical and chemical composition of the urinary stones and on the effective environmental factors that assist in developing the different types of urinary stones. Using X-ray diffraction techniques, the mineralogical composition of the urinary stones was found to be as follows: oxalate, cholesten, and uric acid, with cystine stones occuring more frequently than the others. Cholesten and calcium oxalate stones are the most dominant types of stones. Calcium oxalate is the most common type of oxalate stone. Calcium oxalate is represented in: whewellite, wheddellite, and calcium carbonate oxalate hydrate minerals, in addition to other minerals such as brushite, ammonium phosphate, vaterite, valleriite, and bobierrite from other types of stones. Bobierrite (phosphate group) is a new mineral reported in urinary stones, and this has not been determined in any previous study worldwide. Apatite (calcium phosphate) is deduced using scanning electron microscope (SEM) images. The SEM technique determined crystal forms and systems, shapes, morphological features, and the names of the minerals forming urine stones, while optical properties are studied by polarizing microscope. X-ray fluorescence technique determined the concentrations of major and some trace elements. It revealed that Ca is the main constituent of the urinary stones, especially those composed of calcium oxalate and calcium phosphate. The concentration of trace elements was Ba = 1.57, P = 3.61, Fe = 1.78, S = 2.08, Zr = 4.63, Mo = 3.92, Cu = 1.89, Co = 1.56, and F = 4.2% and was higher in the urinary stones of Jordanian patients than in foreigners in the country. Questionnaires completed by patients suggest that the most significant factors directly effecting the formation of stones are water, climate conditions, food rich in protein and rich in different chemicals. Moreover, some drugs and diseases might also help in developing other stones. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2007. © 2008 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.; MEDLINE® is the source for the MeSH terms of this document.

AB  - Background: Several dietary factors have been considered to be involved in the increasing incidence of colorectal cancer in industrialised countries. Experimental and epidemiological evidence has been suggestive but not conclusive for a protective role for high dietary calcium intake. Intervention studies with colorectal cancer as an endpoint are difficult to perform owing to the large number of patients and the long follow-up required; studies using the appearance of colorectal adenomatous polyps as a surrogate endpoint are therefore considered in reviewing the existing evidence. Objectives: This systematic review aims to assess the effect of supplementary dietary calcium on the incidence of colorectal cancer and the incidence or recurrence of adenomatous polyps. Search strategy: We searched the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, the Cochrane Colorectal Cancer Group specialised register, MEDLINE, Cancerlit , and Embase, to July 2007. The reference lists of identified studies were inspected for further studies, and the review literature was scrutinized. Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials of the effects of dietary calcium on the development of colonic cancer and adenomatous polyps in humans are reviewed. Studies of healthy adults and studies of adults at higher risk of colon cancer due to family history, previous adenomatous polyps, or inflammatory bowel disease were considered; data from subjects with familial polyposis coli are excluded. The primary outcomes were the occurrence of colon cancer, and occurrence or recurrence of any new adenomas of the colon. Secondary outcomes were any adverse event that required discontinuation of calcium supplementation, and drop-outs before the end of the study. Data collection and analysis: Two reviewers independently extracted data, assessed trial quality and resolved discrepancies by consensus. The outcomes were reported as odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). The data were combined with the fixed effects model. Main results: Two studies with 1346 subjects met the inclusion criteria. Both trials were well designed, double - blind, placebo controlled trials, included participants with previous adenomas. The doses of supplementary elemental calcium used were 1200 mg daily for a mean duration of 4 years, and 2000 mg/day for three years.The rates of loss to follow -up were 14 % and 11%. For the development of recurrent colorectal adenoma, a reduction was found (OR 0.74, CI 0.58,0.95) when the results from both trials were combined. Authors' conclusions: Although the evidence from two RCTs suggests that calcium supplementation might contribute to amoderate degree to the prevention of colorectal adenomatous polyps, this does not constitute sufficient evidence to recommend the general use of calcium supplements to prevent colorectal cancer.

AB  - Renal tract stones are common, more so in men, and among Asians and Caucasians, especially in warm climates. They are associated with a greater consumption of animal protein and refined foods, and decreased fluid intake. There are several types, most commonly consisting of calcium phosphates and oxalates; others are composed of magnesium ammonium phosphate (struvite), uric acid or cystine. Struvite stones are associated with urinary tract infections, often of urease-secreting bacteria that increase urinary ammonium concentration. Calcium stones may form for a number of reasons, including hypercalciuria and hyperoxaluria. Hypercalciuria may arise from changes to calcium resorption from bone, or renal and gastrointestinal tract handling of calcium; these are often associated with changes to parathyroid hormone secretion. Hyperoxaluria can arise from increased production or increased gut absorption. Other factors causing hypercalciuria include renal tubular acidosis or conditions that reduce the urinary concentrations of certain inhibitors, such as citrate and magnesium. Uric acid and cystine stones can form as a result of increased production or urinary concentration of the primary constituents. The assessment, investigation and management of patients with different types of stones is described. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - There has been considerable investigation into the health benefits of calcium citrate malate (CCM) since it was first patented in the late 1980s. This chapter is a comprehensive summary of the supporting science and available evidence on the bioavailability and health benefits of consuming CCM. It highlights the important roles that CCM can play during various life stages. CCM has been shown to facilitate calcium retention and bone accrual in children and adolescents. In adults, it effectively promotes the consolidation and maintenance of bone mass. In conjunction with vitamin D, CCM also decreases bone fracture risk in the elderly, slows the rate of bone loss in old age, and is of benefit to the health and well-being of postmenopausal women. CCM is exceptional in that it confers many unique benefits that go beyond bone health. Unlike other calcium sources that necessitate supplementation be in conjunction with a meal to ensure an appreciable benefit is derived, CCM can be consumed with or without food and delivers a significant nutritional benefit to individuals of all ages. The chemistry of CCM makes it a particularly beneficial calcium source for individuals with hypochlorydia or achlorydia, which generally includes the elderly and those on medications that decrease gastric acid secretion. CCM is also recognized as a calcium source that does not increase the risk of kidney stones, and in fact it protects against stone-forming potential. The versatile nature of CCM makes it a convenient and practical calcium salt for use in moist foods and beverages. The major factor that may preclude selection of CCM as a preferred calcium source is the higher cost compared to other sources of calcium commonly used for fortification (e.g., calcium carbonate and tricalcium phosphate). However, formation of CCM directly within beverages or other fluid foods and/or preparations, and the addition of a concentrated CCM solution or slurry, are relatively cost-effective methods by which CCM can be incorporated into finished food and beverage products. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Most Americans do not meet the adequate intake (AI) for calcium; calcium supplements can help meet requirements. Calcium supplementation has been found to be beneficial for bone health in children, young adults, and menopausal women. In addition to calcium, vitamin D is necessary for bone health and is generally deficient in the industrialized world. Calcium from carbonate and citrate are the most common forms of calcium supplements. Calcium carbonate, the most cost-effective form, should be taken with a meal to ensure optimal absorption. Calcium citrate can be taken without food and is the supplement of choice for individuals with achlorhydria or who are taking histamine-2 blockers or proteinpump inhibitors. Calcium lactate and calcium gluconate are less concentrated forms of calcium and are not practical oral supplements. Research on hydroxyapatite as a source of calcium is limited, so this form of calcium is not recommended. The maximum dose of elemental calcium that should be taken at a time is 500 mg. U.S. Pharmacopeia-verified calcium supplements meet vigorous manufacturing and quality requirements. Absorption from calcium-fortified beverages varies and in general is not equal to that of milk. Potential adverse effects of calcium supplementation include gastrointestinal complaints. Renal calculi in most studies have not been associated with calcium supplementation. The risk of advanced and fatal prostate cancer has been associated with calcium intakes from food or supplements in amounts >1500 mg/d.

AB  - The introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in 1996 dramatically changed the course of HIV infection. This therapy involves the use of at least three agents from two distinct classes of antivirals: a protease inhibitor (PI) in combination with two nucleoside/ nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (N(t)RTIs), or a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) in combination with NRTIs. Nine drugs containing PIs are clinically available: the first generation ones, saquinavir, ritonavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, and amprenavir, and the second generation ones, fosamprenavir (the amprenavir prodrug), lopinavir, atazanavir, and tipranavir. Many other compounds are in advanced clinical evaluation, such as among others TMC-114, whereas a lot of different other effective HIV protease inhibitors were reported, mainly by using amprenavir and TMC-114 as lead molecules. The main goals of research in this field are: (i) the design of better pharmacological agents, devoid of severe side effects, resistance problems and with simple administration schedules (preferably once daily), and (ii) achieving eradication of the virus, and possibly, a definifive cure of the disease. A review on the pharmacology and interactions of these agents with other drugs is presented here, with emphasis on how these pharmacological interferences may improve the clinical use of antivirals, or how side effects due to PI drugs may be managed better by taking them into account (such as for example ritonavir boosting of other PIs which reduces dosages and administration schedules of these drugs). Except for being highly effective in the treatment of HIV infection, recent reports showed this class of drugs to be effective as antitumor agents, as antibacterials (for example against Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection), antifungals (against Candida albicans), antimalarials antiSARS and anti-influenza agents. © 2007 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd. © 2009 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.; MEDLINE® is the source for the MeSH terms of this document.

AB  - Medical treatment of cystinuria is often disappointing. Patients undergo frequent surgery, which is often followed by early relapse. The aim of our study was to evaluate the efficacy of medical treatment of cystinuria, to prevent formation or to reduce the numbers and dimensions of renal stones. Twenty cystinuric patients were treated with a combined approach, including cystine-binding drugs. Free and bound urine cystine levels were measured every 4 months. Drug dosage was adjusted to maintain free urine cystine level below 100 μmol/mmol creatinine. Eighteen patients completed the study; detection of new stones was reduced from 0.28 per year to 0.03 per year, and, in six patients, the numbers and dimensions of pre-existing renal stones were reduced. Surgery was required in one subject, and no relapse was observed 12 months afterwards. The dosage required to achieve target levels was closely correlated with patient body weight: older children required a lower dose. Medical management of cystinuria is feasible. The treatment must be personalised in children, as the amount of drug required is strictly dependent on body size. © IPNA 2007. © 2008 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.; MEDLINE® is the source for the MeSH terms of this document.

AB  - Carcinoma of the parathyroid gland is infrequent in patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism. Typical clinical symptoms are related to the presence of a neck mass and hypercalcemia. We describe a case of a 55-year-old man in whom primary parathyroid carcinoma led most likely to the development of end-stage dialysis-dependent renal failure, and the diagnosis of the cancer was delayed due to ectopic localization of the tumor, and dramatic complications in the clinical course of the disease, including acute pancreatitis and peritionitis. However, 6 months after successful surgery and subsequent radiotherapy, the patient is well and free from recurrences but remains chronically dialysis-dependent. © 2007 International Society for Hemodialysis. © 2008 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.; MEDLINE® is the source for the MeSH terms of this document.

AB  - Introduction: Hereditary xanthinuria, due to a purine metabolism disorder, is a rare cause of urinary lithiasis in children. Case: We report the case of a child aged 3 and a half years, who presented recurrent urinary lithiasis that led to destruction of the right kidney. Infrared spectrophotometric analysis of the calculus concluded that it was composed of 100% xanthine. Laboratory tests showed hypouricemia and hypouricosuria with elevated urinary excretion of oxypurines. These findings led to a diagnosis of hereditary xanthinuria. Conclusion: Early diagnosis of this rare disease is essential to avoid its complications. Metabolic causes must be sought in children with lithiasis. © 2007 Elsevier Masson SAS.

AB  - Anecdotal reports of adverse drug reactions are generally regarded as being of poor evidential quality. This is especially relevant for postmarketing drug safety surveillance, which relies heavily on spontaneous anecdotal reports. The numerous limitations of spontaneous reports cannot be overemphasised, but there is another side to the story: these datasets also contain anecdotal reports that can be considered to describe definitive adverse reactions, without the need for further formal verification. We have previously defined four categories of such adverse reactions: (i) extracellular or intracellular tissue deposition of the drug or a metabolite; (ii) a specific anatomical location or pattern of injury; (iii) physiological dysfunction or direct tissue damage demonstrable by physicochemical testing; and (iv) infection, as a result of the administration of an infective agent as the therapeutic substance or because of demonstrable contamination. In this article, we discuss the implications of these definitive ('between-the-eyes') adverse effects for pharmacovigilance. © 2007 Adis Data Information BV.

AB  - Ammonium chloride @ 500 mg/kg body weight, after dissolving in water, was administered orally to affect urinary acidification in 8 goats, suffering from obstructive urolithiasis, after tube cystostomy. A significant decrease in blood pH, pO<inf>2</inf>, haematocrit, haemoglobin, sodium, bicarbonate and BE up to 24 h. In contrast, a rise in pCO<inf>2</inf>, potassium and chloride was recorded. The values for all the parameters, however, were still with in the normal range. Urinary pH was maintained in acidic range up to day 5. The results of the study suggested that single oral dose of ammonium chloride 500 mg/kg is sufficient to acidify the urine in goats suffering from obstructive urolithiasis for 5 days without inducing alarming changes in blood gases, acid-base and electrolyte profile. © 2008 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Nephrolithiasis is a worldwide disease with high clinical and economic costs. The increasing incidence in industrialized countries seems to be related to several risk factors, which are partly inherited and partly acquired. Although risk factors in urolithiasis are still under discussion, their identification would provide a notable gain for the patient in terms of stone episodes, and for the health service in terms of costs. This article presents an easy classification of risk factors based on clinical background. Copyright © 2007 S.

AB  - Extreme obesity remains a frustrating and formidable disease, with most sufferers requiring surgical intervention in order to achieve long-term, sustained weight loss. Most bariatric procedures today are performed on women, many of whom are of reproductive age; yet minimal evidence exists to guide clinicians in the care of such women before, during, and after pregnancy. This review outlines the fundamental nutritional and surgical alterations of the most commonly performed bariatric procedures with the aim to elucidate a physiologically sound approach to counseling and management of extremely obese women of childbearing age who are either contemplating or have already undergone bariatric surgery. Preconception, pregnancy, and lactation guidelines are offered based on available evidence. Outstanding questions are highlighted for further investigation.

AB  - Objectives of the study were to measure water hardness in Burdur, and to establish its possible association with urolithiasis in cattle. Water samples were obtained from different stables (n = 15). Water hardness and the concentrations of potassium, calcium, magnesium, sodium, iron, zinc, manganese and copper ions were calculated from these water samples. Total hardness of the samples (mean 285 ppm) exceeded the standards and the water was characterized by high content of magnesium ions. Kidneys (n = 500) were collected randomly from slaughterhouses and examined for urolithiasis. Urolithiasis was observed in 102 kidneys (20.4%). The weights of the stones were between 0.02 and 237.44 g and the colour varied from white to brown. The calculi collected had various shapes and composed of calcium apatite (42.45%), struvite (20.15%), magnesium carbonate (15.15%), calcium carbonate (12.12%), and calcium phosphate cystine (10.13%). It was concluded that high water hardness with high magnesium ion concentrations in water may contribute to urolithiasis and needs to be investigated further in future studies. © Springer Science+Business Media, Inc. 2007. © 2008 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.; MEDLINE® is the source for the MeSH terms of this document.

AB  - Epilepsy in the elderly is more prevalent than commonly believed.With a few exceptions, selection of AED therapy for older patients has been extrapolated from the results of trials in young adults. Although open-label, uncontrolled trials do not prove efficacy, they help the clinician learn about the tolerability of AEDs and practical suggestions for their use. Double-blind, prospective comparative AED trials in the elderly patient with epilepsy have demonstrated that the newer AEDs gabapentin or lamotrigine are better tolerated than the standard AED carbamazepine, and there is less likelihood of an older patient to stop taking gabapentin or lamotrigine due to intolerable adverse effects or lack of efficacy. A study comparing the effectiveness of levetiracetam to carbamazepine in older patients with epilepsy is currently underway. A prospective study comparing the effectiveness of all available AEDs in older patients (or any age group for that matter) is time and labor-intensive, as well as statistically prohibitive. Each patient should be treated individually. Affordability of an AED is a must since there is no sense in prescribing an AED that the patient does not have access to. The first given responsibility of health providers is to do no harm. In patients with liver disease, AEDs that are metabolized in the liver may be avoided or their doses adjusted at the least. Patients with renal disease may need significantly smaller doses to maintain therapeutic effect. AEDs associated with renal stones may not be choice drugs for patients with personal or family history of renal stones. AEDs that may accelerate osteoporosis should especially be avoided in frail older patients. Patients taking sodium-losing drugs may have clinically significant hyponatremia should AEDs associated with hyponatremia be added. AEDs associated with tremor may significantly impair the quality of life of patients with preexisting tremor. Patients with known allergies to certain drugs should not be exposed to AEDs known to have cross-reactivity with those drugs. AEDs associated with agitation and irritability should be used carefully in patients with prior history of hostility or impulse dyscontrol. To minimize pharmacokinetic drug interactions, patients may benefit better from AEDs that are not metabolized in the liver or highly protein-bound. AEDs associated with weight gain or weight loss should be regarded with caution in obese and slim patients, respectively. On the other hand, patients with epilepsy and problems related to headache, insomnia, mania, depression, overweight, underweight, or neuropathic pain may welcome an AED with antimigraine, hypnotic, antimanic, antidepressant, weight loss, weight gain, or analgesic properties, respectively. Finally, as older patients may be more sensitive to AEDs where intolerable adverse effects may occur at lower doses and efficacy at lower serum levels compared to younger adults, it behooves health providers to start AED doses low and titrate slow. © 2008 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Milk of calcium is a viscous colloidal suspension of calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate, or calcium oxalate, or a mixture of these compounds. The calcific material gravitates to the dependent portion of a cystic cavity. Crescent- or hemisphere-shaped calcium density with a sharp horizontal upper border at the milk of calcium-clear fluid interface confirms the diagnosis. Bilateral milk of calcium in the renal pelvis or in dilated calyces is very rare and has not been reported in patients with spinal cord injury. A 63-year-old male patient with T-10 paraplegia presented with recurrent urinary tract infections. X-ray of the kidneys, taken with the vertical beam while the patient lay supine, revealed a poorly defined opacity overlying the lower pole of the right kidney. Findings on ultrasonography of the kidneys were interpreted as a large, staghorn-type calculus in the dilated lower pole calyx of the right kidney. Because x-ray of the kidneys showed a poorly defined opacity overlying the lower pole of the right kidney, milk of calcium was suspected, and computed tomography (CT) of the kidneys was performed. Calcific debris with horizontal layering in the lower pole calyces of both kidneys was seen; this confirmed the diagnosis of milk of calcium. A 62-year-old female patient with C-7 tetraplegia underwent ileal conduit urinary diversion. Subsequently, she developed calculi in the right kidney, which were treated with shock wave lithotripsy. Follow-up x-ray revealed faintly opaque shadows with indistinct margins in the region of both kidneys. Intravenous urography showed cortical thinning at the upper poles and blunting of the calyces, suggestive of chronic pyelonephritis. The right renal pelvis was bulky, and bilateral renal calculi were diagnosed during ultrasonography; however, the presence of faintly radio-opaque shadows with indistinct margins raised suspicions of renal milk of calcium. A CT scan of the kidneys, which was performed in the supine and subsequently in the prone position, revealed gravity-dependent layering of calcific material in the pelves of both kidneys and in the midpole calyces of the right kidney, thus confirming the diagnosis of milk of calcium. In conclusion, CT scan of the kidneys confirmed the diagnosis of bilateral renal milk of calcium, a very rare entity in patients with spinal cord injury. Awareness of typical and unique features of milk of calcium during imaging enables physicians to recognize renal milk of calcium and to differentiate it from nephrolithiasis, thereby avoiding unwarranted interventions such as shock wave lithotripsy or endoscopic procedures. ©2007 Health Communications Inc. © 2012 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.; MEDLINE® is the source for the MeSH terms of this document.

AB  - An Andalusier stallion was presented to the reporting clinic with a history of chronic hematuria and bladder inflammation. A cystic calculus (6,5 × 5,5 × 4 cm) was diagnosed sonographically. The surgical technique of choice for treatment was the paramedian laparocystotomy in dorsal recumbency. There were no intra- or postoperative complications and only a minor incisional swelling the following days. On long-term follow-up no recurrence of clinical signs associated with cystic calculi occurred. The urolith was composed of calcium carbonate in form of the mineral calcit and minor quantities of carbonatapatite. © Schlütersche Verlagsgesellschaft mbH &Co, KG. © 2011 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Atazanavir is the first once-daily azapeptide HIV protease inhibitor that may offer simpler and safer protease inhibitor-based highly active antiretroviral therapy, as it has been associated with less hyperlipemia and diarrhea compared with the other drugs of the same class. The typical side effect of atazanavir is an asymptomatic increase in serum unconjugated bilirubin. Ritonavir-boosted atazanavir has proved to be effective in treatment-naive HIV-infected individuals, and there is no evidence that it leads to the selection of mutations conferring cross-resistance to other protease inhibitors. Its efficacy in patients harboring drug-resistant variants is not statistically different from that of the reference protease inhibitor, lopinavir/ritonavir. It has been approved by the US FDA for use in drug-experienced HIV-infected patients, although atazonavir/ritonavir-based regimens have now been included among those recommended by the International AIDS Society - USA Panel and the Department of Health and Human Services Panel as initial treatment. The aim of this article is to describe the pharmacological characteristics of atazanavir/ritonavir, and the results of the main clinical trials investigating the safety and efficacy of this antiretroviral combination. © 2007 Future Medicine Ltd. © 2008 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The final phenotype of patients. with cystinuria depends on the absence or molecular defect, more o less acute, of the transport of cystine and dibasic aminoacids, and, also on environmental factors. The objective of this work is to study the effect of the modulation of some environmental factors (urinary pH, intake of liquids, pharmacological treatment and, specially, diet) on the final phenotype of the patient with cystinuria. METHODS: We study 45 patients with cystinuria (25 men and 20 women), 42 relatives (15 men and 27 women) and 90 unrelated controls. Anthropometric, clinical (personal and familiar history of urinary infections, colics and calculi expulsion), biochemical (microscopy analysis of urine and urinary aminoacids cuantification) and life style (diet and medical treatment) variables were obtained. Statistical analysis was performed using tests to compare means and frequencies and, also, logistic regression and multivariate analysis. RESULTS: Of the 45 patients with cystinuria, only 20% showed cystine cristalls in urine, the rest of the phenotypical manifestations of cystinuria were found with the same prevalence as in relatives and in the control group. 50% of the patients did not undergo any therapeutic intervention; of these, only 50% were effective. In patients with cystinuria, the presence of cystine cristalls was associated with a diet rich in meats and poor in milk products (p<0.05). Meat consumption also tend to associate with a higher risk of urinary infections, meanwhile the stone expulsion showed a negative tendance with a diet rich in phytate. The elevate consumption of oranges and mandarins was the variable of the diet which was more associated with urinary aminoacids concentrations, specially with lower levels of lysine and arginine (p<0,05). CONCLUSIONS: Some components of the diet, in addition to standard treatment, modulate the phenotypical manifestations of cystinuria. © 2008 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.; MEDLINE® is the source for the MeSH terms of this document.

AB  - Few controlled studies are available to guide the clinician in treating potentially assaultive elderly individuals with psychiatric disorders. Safety concerns limit the use of benzodiazepines and antipsychotic medications in the elderly individual, making anticonvulsants an attractive alternative. This paper reviews three specific anticonvulsants for this purpose: gabapentin, oxcarbazepine and topiramate, describing safety and efficacy in elderly patients with severe agitation from psychosis or dementia. Gabapentin, renally excreted, with a half-life of 6.5 - 10.5 h, may cause ataxia. Oxcarbazapine, hepatically reduced, may cause hyponatremia, and topiramate may cause significant cognitive impairment. Nonetheless, these are important medications to consider in the treatment of agitation. © 2007 Informa UK Ltd. © 2008 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.; MEDLINE® is the source for the MeSH terms of this document.

AB  - Urolithiasis is a relatively common disorder with a high recurrence rate. Medical, metabolic, and nutritional factors contribute to or cause stone formation, particularly idiopathic calcium oxalate urolithiasis. Medical factors include bowel disorders, family history of kidney stones, insulin resistance, gout, excessive bone resorption, primary hyperparathyroidism, renal tubular acidosis, and chronic urinary tract infections. Metabolic factors include low urinary pH, hypercalciuria, hypocitraturia, hyperoxaluria, and hyperuricosuria, which may exist alone or in various combinations within individual patients. Nutritional factors include a high intake of animal protein, oxalate, and sodium and a low intake of fluids, calcium, and fruits and vegetables. Nutrition therapy, to be applied in all patients with stones, includes a high fluid intake, low sodium intake, a moderate animal protein intake, and ample fruits and vegetables, especially those rich in potassium, magnesium, and citric acid. When indicated by biochemical and medical data, an oxalate restriction may be required. As nutrition therapy may not sufficiently control stone formation in the presence of severe metabolic abnormalities, pharmacologic intervention is warranted. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Herein we describe the case of a 64-year-old woman with hypoparathyroidism diagnosed at the age of 40, after an acute episode of tetany and seizures due to severe hypocalcemia. She was treated for more than 20 years with calcitriol and calcium supplementation but she presented with marked hypercalciuria and recently nephrolithiasis, although serum calcium was maintained at levels below normal range. Provided that any attempt to increase the recommended dose of calcitriol was leading to an exacerbation of hypercalciuria, we decided to enroll an alternative tool in the treatment strategy. In order to avoid further deterioration of renal function she was administered once-daily a subcutaneous (sc) injection of synthetic human parathyroid hormone (PTH 1-34) while doses of calcium and calcitriol were gradually decreased depending on the response of calcium metabolism in serum and urine samples taken periodically. Within two months of administration, PTH (1-34) significantly reduced the level of urine calcium excretion compared with calcitriol therapy and maintained serum calcium in the normal range. The relevant literature is reviewed in light of this alternative therapeutic approach in long-standing hypoparathyroidism, illustrating the potential benefits and the unresolved issues in parathyroid hormone replacement. © J.

AB  - Background and Purpose: Studies reporting the outcome of percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) in relation to stone burden and configuration are limited. We analyzed our stone-free and complication rates of PCNL with regard to stone surface area and configuration. Patients and Methods: Data of 234 patients who underwent PCNL were analyzed retrospectively. Patients were stratified into six groups according to stone burden and into four groups in relation to stone configuration. Groups were compared with respect to the number of tracts, success of therapy, complications, requirement for secondary procedures, drop in hematocrit, and blood transfusion requirement. Results: The overall stone-free rate was 78.6% with a complication rate of 34.6%. Stone-free rates decreased with increasing stone size (P = 0.001) and with increasing caliceal component in complex stones (P = 0.01). The total number of complications rose with increasing stone surface area (P = 0.0001); however, stone distribution within the kidney did not affect the complication rate (P = 0.2). The mean operative time rose with increasing stone burden (P < 0.05) and increasing caliceal involvement by complex stones (P < 0.01). The need for multiple tracts also rose with increasing stone burden (P < 0.05). Conclusion: There is a decrease in the overall stone-free rate, as well as an increase in the complication rate, the secondary procedure rate, the mean operative time, and the need for multiple tracts, with increasing stone surface area with PCNL. With regard to stone configuration, there is a decrease in the stone-free rate, as well as an increase in the operative time, with increasing caliceal component in complex renal stones. © Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Urinary calculi formation is often observed in guinea pigs (Cavia porcellus), mainly calcium-containing uroliths (calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate, calcium oxalate) are found. Stone formation processes are very common in mammals, however, rodents are more susceptible in comparison with other species. The aim of the trial was to evaluate the impacts of nutrients on stone formation. Density and pH-value of the urine are parameters which highly influence stone generation. In the present study the influence of giving fresh, water containing feedstuffs was tested (salad, carrots, apples), as well as feed mixture, supplemented with methionine in concentrations of 1.75; 2.75; 3.35; 4.95 and 5.75 g/kg was used in this trial. The different ratios were tested on 16 female guinea pigs of 2.5 years old. Adjusting period took 9 days, urine collection period lasted 5 days. Urine volume, density and pH-value were determined daily within the 5 day collection period. For the determination of the mineral content (calcium, magnesium, phosphorus), the urine of the 5-day-period was collected and homogenized. The microscopic evaluation of urines revealed that the most frequently excreted stone types are calcium carbonate, calcium phoshate and struvite. The obtained results suggest, that fresh green feedstuffs increased urine volume and reduced pH values. Methionine premixes had no marked impact on any of the urine parametres observed. © 2013 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The efficacy of calcium with vitamin D supplementation for preventing hip and other fractures in healthy post-menopausal women remains equivocal. The authors recruited 36,282 postmenopausal women, 50-79 years of age, who were already enrolled in a Women's Health Initiative (WHI) clinical trial. Participants were randomly assigned to receive 1,000 mg/d of elemental calcium as calcium carbonate with 400 IU/d of vitamin D3 or placebo. Fractures were ascertained for an average follow-up period of 7.0 years. Bone density was measured at three WHI centers. Hip bone density was 1.06% higher in the calcium plus vitamin D group than in the placebo group (P < 0.01). Intention-to-treat analysis indicated that participants receiving calcium plus vitamin D supplementation had a hazard ratio of 0.88 for hip fracture (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.72-1.08), 0.90 for clinical spine fracture (CI 0.74-1.10), and 0.96 for total fractures (CI 0.91-1.02). The risk of renal calculi increased with calcium plus vitamin D (hazard ratio 1.17; CI 1.02-1.34). Censoring data from women when they ceased to adhere to the study medication reduced the hazard ratio for hip fracture to 0.71 (CI 0.52-0.97). Effects did not vary significantly according to prerandomization serum vitamin D levels. Among healthy postmenopausal women, calcium with vitamin D supplementation resulted in a small but significant improvement in hip bone density, did not significantly reduce hip fracture, and increased the risk of kidney stones. © 2011 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To identify an appropriate sampling technique(s) to accurately detect the bacteria causing urinary tract infections in dogs with urolithiasis. METHODS: Twenty-one dogs with urolithiasis were included in the study. Three types of samples were taken from each dog. Urine was collected by cystocentesis, and a urinary bladder mucosal biopsy and urolith were retrieved during cystotomy. The samples were then cultured on blood agar and MacConkey's agar to identify the bacteria associated with urinary tract infections. RESULTS: Bacterial urinary tract infection was found in 16 cases (76.19 per cent). The most prevalent bacteria found to cause urinary tract infection were Escherichia coli (n=7), followed by coagulase-positive Staphylococcus species (n=4), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n=2), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n=2) and Proteus mirabilis (n=1). In the case of a positive urine culture, the same bacteria were also cultured from the urinary bladder mucosal biopsy alone or from both the urinary bladder mucosal biopsy and urolith. However, in the case of a negative urine culture, bacteria were found to be present in the urinary bladder mucosal biopsy or urolith cultures in 23.81 per cent of dogs. The uroliths that gave positive culture results were either infection-induced uroliths composed of struvite and calcium carbonate phosphate, ammonium acid urate only or metabolic uroliths composed of calcium oxalate and calcium phosphate, or calcium phosphate only. All the uroliths that gave negative culture results were metabolic uroliths composed of calcium oxalate and/or calcium phosphate, and uric acid and calcium phosphate. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: When the culture from the urine obtained by cystocentesis is negative, cultures of urinary bladder mucosal biopsy and urolith are recommended in dogs with urolithiasis in order to accurately assess the microbiological status of the urinary tract. © 2006 British Small Animal Veterinary Association. © 2008 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.; MEDLINE® is the source for the MeSH terms of this document.

AB  - Osteoporosis is a major cause of morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs. The socioeconomic burden of osteoporosis is likely to increase dramatically if improvements in prevention are not made. Calcium supplementation effectively reduces the rate of bone loss in postmenopausal women, yet most women do not achieve an adequate calcium intake. In fact, use of calcium supplementation appears to have declined as the more effective antiresorptive therapies, such as bisphosphonates, have become available. Among patients prescribed bisphosphonates, calcium intake is often insufficient, despite the fact that adequate calcium intake may be necessary to gain the maximum benefits from antiresorptive therapy. In addition, because calcium interferes with bisphosphonate absorption, incorrect use of calcium may limit the efficacy of bisphosphonate therapy. This underscores the need for new initiatives to reduce the confusion surrounding appropriate calcium use during antiresorptive therapy. Co-packaging of bisphosphonates with calcium supplements is one strategy to help ensure that patients taking bisphosphonates not only achieve adequate calcium intake but also gain the maximum benefit from bisphosphonate therapy. © 2006 Adis Data Information BV.

AB  - Osteoporosis is a disease of fragility fractures related to decreased bone density and poor bone quality. Men and women develop osteoporosis, with the disease in men more often a consequence of secondary causes and occurring at a later period of time. Men have a lower rate of fracture; however, they have a much higher mortality rate than women at any given age. Diagnosis is relatively comparable between men and women and the treatment is similar, with the exception of the selective estrogen receptor modulators. New treatments are currently under development, but our efforts also should be aimed at prevention and early detection. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Metabolic evaluation of stone-forming (SF) patients is based on the determination of calcium, oxalate, citrate, uric acid and other parameters in 24-h urine samples under a random diet. A reliable measurement of urinary oxalate requires the collection of urine in a receptacle containing acid preservative. However, urinary uric acid cannot be determined in the same sample under this condition. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that the addition of preservatives (acid or alkali) after urine collection would not modify the results of those lithogenic parameters. Thirty-four healthy subjects (HS) were submitted to two non-consecutive collections of 24-h urine. The first sample was collected in a receptacle containing hydrochloric acid (HCl 6 N) and the second in a dry plastic container, with HCl being added as soon as the urine sample was received at the laboratory. Additionally, 34 HS and 34 SF patients collected a spot urine sample that was divided into four aliquots, one containing HCl, another containing sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO<inf>3</inf> 5 g/l), and two others in which these two preservative agents were added 24 h later. Urinary oxalate, calcium, magnesium, citrate, creatinine and uric acid were determined. Urinary parameters were also evaluated in the presence of calcium oxalate or uric acid crystals. Mean values of all urinary parameters obtained from previously acidified 24-h urine samples did not differ from those where acid was added after urine collection. The same was true for spot urine samples, with the exception of urinary citrate that presented a slight albeit significant change of 5.9% between samples in HS and 3.1% in SF. Uric acid was also not different between pre- and post-alkalinized spot urine samples. The presence of crystals did not alter these results. We concluded that post-delivery acidification or alkalinization of urine samples does not modify the measured levels of urinary oxalate, calcium, magnesium, creatinine and uric acid, and that the change on citrate was not relevant, hence allowing all parameters to be determined in a single urine sample, thus avoiding the inconvenience and cost of multiple 24-h urine sample collections. © 2006 Springer-Verlag. © 2011 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.; MEDLINE® is the source for the MeSH terms of this document.

AB  - Prolonged cell proliferation in response to irritation by calculi may itself evoke malignant transformation of the urothelium. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this process are still unknown. The aim of the present study was to investigate cell cycle regulatory mechanisms in bladder carcinogenesis induced by bladder calculi. Six-week-old Wistar rats were consecutively fed a diet containing 5% terephthalic acid (TPA), 5% TPA plus 4% sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO<inf>3</inf>), 4% NaHCO<inf>3</inf>, or basal diet for 48 weeks. Animals were killed at weeks 12, 24, and 48. Treatment with 5% TPA caused high incidences of bladder calculi, preneoplastic lesions, and neoplastic lesions. Immunohistochemical examination revealed overexpression of cyclin D1, cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (Cdk4), retinoblastoma (Rb), and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) in bladder preneoplastic and neoplastic lesions. In contrast, p16 expression was reduced or absent. These results were confirmed by immunoblotting analysis. Quantitation of mRNA by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) showed a significant increase in cyclin D1 and PCNA mRNA in tumor cells. None of the 16 transitional cell carcinomas (TCCs) had ras mutations as examined by PCR-single strand conformational polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) analysis. These results suggested that deregulation of p16-cyclin D1/Cdk4-Rb pathway, but not oncogenic activation of ras, plays a crucial role in bladder tumorigenesis induced by bladder calculi. © 2006 Springer-Verlag. © 2011 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.; MEDLINE® is the source for the MeSH terms of this document.

AB  - Focal-onset seizures are manifestations of abnormal epileptic firing of brain cells in a localised area or areas of the brain. The diagnosis of focal-onset seizures initially entails an EEG, a detailed history from the patient and eyewitnesses, as well as computer tomographic or, preferably, magnetic resonance imaging scans. Video EEG to record ictal events may be necessary to establish the correct diagnosis. Focal seizures are classified according to the International Classification of Epileptic Seizures and International Classification of Epilepsies and Epilepsy Syndromes. It is important to try to decide how the seizure event fits into this system in order to successfully evaluate and optimise treatment, as well as to give detailed information to the patient about their seizures and prognosis. Once the decision to treat the seizures has been made, the physician must choose which medication is the most appropriate to begin with. Carbamazepine, phenytoin or valproic acid (sodium valproate) are often rated as first-line drugs, but factors such as adverse-effect profiles, age, possibility of pregnancy, and concomitant diseases and medication also need to be considered. Most of the newer antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) appear to have good efficacy and better tolerability than the older agents, but evidence to support their superiority is scarce and has led to conflicting advice in several guidelines. Among the newer AEDs, lamotrigine, gabapentin, topiramate and oxcarbazepine have obtained monotherapy indication in many countries. The higher costs of the newer AEDs may inhibit their wider use, especially in poorer countries. © 2006 Adis Data Information BV.

AB  - Osteoporosis and related fractures are a significant concern for the global community. As the population continues to age, morbidity and mortality from fractures due to low bone mineral density (BMD) will likely continue to increase. Efforts should be made to screen those at risk for osteoporosis, identify and address various risk factors for falls and associated fractures, ensure adequate calcium and vitamin D intake, and institute pharmacological therapy to increase BMD when indicated. Agents which increase BMD and have been shown to decrease fractures, particularly at the hip, should be considered preferentially over those for which only BMD data are available. Drugs which have been shown to decrease the risk of age-related osteoporotic fractures include oral bisphosphonates (alendronate, ibandronate, and risedronate), intranasal calcitonin, estrogen receptor stimulators (eg, estrogen, selective estrogen receptor modulators [raloxifene]), parathyroid hormone (teriparatide), sodium fluoride, and strontium ranelate. Data are beginning to emerge supporting various combination therapies (eg, bisphosphonate plus an estrogen receptor stimulator), though more data are needed to identify combinations which are most effective and confer added fracture protection. In addition, further research is needed to identify ideal regimens in special populations such as nursing home patients and men. © 2006 Dove Medical Press Limited.

AB  - Constipation, defined as a delay or difficulty in defecation, present for 2 or more weeks, is a common pediatric problem encountered by both primary and specialty medical providers. The Constipation Guideline Committee of the North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (NASPGHAN) has formulated a clinical practice guideline for the management of pediatric constipation. The Constipation Guideline Committee, consisting of two primary care pediatricians, a clinical epidemiologist, and pediatric gastroenterologists, based its recommendations on an integration of a comprehensive and systematic review of the medical literature combined with expert opinion. Consensus was achieved through Nominal Group Technique, a structured quantitative method. The Committee developed two algorithms to assist with medical management, one for older infants and children and the second for infants less than 1 year of age. The guideline provides recommendations for management by the primary care provider, including evaluation, initial treatment, follow-up management, and indications for consultation by a specialist. The Constipation Guideline Committee also provided recommendations for management by the pediatric gastroenterologist. © 2006 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins. © 2008 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.; MEDLINE® is the source for the MeSH terms of this document.

AB  - Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has dramatically changed the course of HIV infection. This therapy involves the use of at least three agents from two distinct classes of antivirals: a protease inhibitor (PI) in combination with two nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (N(t)RTIs); or a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) in combination with NRTIs. Nine drugs containing PIs are clinically available: the first-generation saquinavir, ritonavir, indinavir, nelfinavir and amprenavir; and the second-generation fosamprenavir (the amprenavir prodrug), lopinavir, atazanavir and tipranavir. Many other compounds are in advanced clinical evaluation, such as darunavir (TMC-114) and brecanavir, among others. Many other effective HIV PIs were reported, mainly by using amprenavir and TMC-114 as lead molecules. The main goals of research in this field are: i) the design of better pharmacological agents, devoid of severe side effects, resistance problems and with simple administration schedules (preferably once-daily); and ii) achieving eradication of the virus and, possibly, a definitive cure of the disease. A review of the pharmacology and interactions of these agents with other drugs is presented here, with emphasis on how these pharmacological interferences may improve the clinical use of antivirals, or how side effects due to PI drugs may be managed better by taking them into account (e.g., ritonavir boosting of other PIs, which reduces dosages and administration schedules of these drugs). Except for being highly effective in the treatment of HIV infection, recent reports showed this class of drugs to be effective as antitumour agents, apoptosis enhancers, antibacterials (e.g., against Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection), antifungals (e.g., against Candida albicans), antimalarials, anti-SARS and anti-influenza agents. © 2006 Informa UK Ltd. © 2008 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - A 54-year-old woman was admitted to our department with the diagnosis of a renal calculus. She exhibited dull left flank pain. A plain film revealed a round opaque calcific density in the left kidney in the supine and the upright position. There was no connection between the calcification and the renal collecting system by retrograde pyelography. Computed tomography in the supine position showed a rounded calcification in the left renal parenchyma without a semilunar configuration. She was diagnosed with left renal calyceal diverticula calculi. She underwent a surgical intervention which found a renal milky stone including a 10-mm. diameter stone. The examination of the fluid and the stone material disclosed three components: calcium phosphate, calcium oxalate and calcium carbonate. The present case is interesting because its characteristics differ from the common features of renal milky stone. © 2011 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.; MEDLINE® is the source for the MeSH terms of this document.

AB  - More than 200,000 patients are diagnosed with primary or metastatic brain tumors each year in the United States. Of these patients, 20% to 40% will develop seizures at presentation, and another 20% to 40% will require treatment for seizures during their illness. Although the use of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) in patients who have had seizures seems reasonable, the issue of prophylactic AED use for patients who have not had a seizure is an intensely debated subject. The American Academy of Neurology released a position statement in May 2000 addressing the use of anticonvulsants in newly diagnosed brain tumor patients who have never had a seizure. After a review of the literature, including all trials showing class I evidence, multivariate analysis using calculated odds ratios failed to show a prophylactic benefit of preventing a first seizure versus the risk of side effects and recommended not using prophylactic anticonvulsants in newly diagnosed patients with brain tumor. Despite this recommendation, a recent survey of the American Association of Neurologic Surgeons revealed that most neurosurgeons still use anticonvulsants prophylactically in patients with brain tumor. This review mainly includes primary brain tumors, but most of the concepts are transferable to patients with metastatic tumors.

AB  - Management of the pregnant patient with GERD continues to be a clinical challenge. Though Likely safe, antisecretory therapy should be used with caution early in pregnancy. Traditional approaches-antacids, sucral-fate and lifestyle modifications-are still the standard recommendation. A safe, perhaps endoscopic therapy would be welcomed by patients with chronic GERD. © 2008 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: A 56-year-old white woman was referred to our institution with a 16-month history of severe, gouty, recurrent, acute polyarthritis involving the finger joints. She also had numerous small subcutaneous tophi in her hands. The patient was intolerant to allopurinol and had mild renal insufficiency attributed to uric-acid nephrolithiasis and interstitial nephropathy. Investigations: Physical examination, la boratory testing, X-rays of the hands, feet and pelvis, CT of the pelvis, microscopic analysis of an aspirate from a finger tophus. Diagnosis: Tophaceous gout associated w ith urate nephropathy in a patient intolerant to allopurinol. Management: Acute polyarthritis was successfully managed by intravenous bolus methylprednisolone combined with codeine, diclofenac and low-dose colchicine. Rasburicase infusions combined with fenofibrate and sodium bicarbonate achieved to maintain serum acid uric below 360 μmol/l. © 2006 Nature Publishing Group. © 2008 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.; MEDLINE® is the source for the MeSH terms of this document.

AB  - Familial Hypomagnesemia, Hypercalciuria with Nephrocalcinosis is a rare autosomal recessive inherited disease associated with renal failure. Two girls born of consanguineous parentage aged 16 and 17 presented to us with renal failure, nephrocalcinosis and bone deformities. On evaluation they were found to have hypomagnesemia, hypercalciuria, increased fractional excretion of magnesium, hypocitraturia, renal failure and elevated PTH. Their parental screening was normal. There were no extra-renal features in them. One sibling had nephrolithiasis and the stone analysis revealed calcium phosphate stones. Both were treated with sodium bicarbonate, thiazides, calcitriol and calcium carbonate. They did not require dialysis during hospital stay. Both of them were treated conservatively. They are on regular outpatient follow up. The primary defect in this syndrome is impaired paracellular reabsorption of magnesium and calcium in the medullary thick ascending limb. Mutations in the PCLN-1gene which encodes for the tight junction protein paracellin-1 is identified as the underlying genetic defect. Ocular abnormalities and deafness are the commonly reported associations. End stage renal failure usually occurs in second to third decade. Renal transplantation is the definite treatment. © JAPI 2006. © 2008 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.; MEDLINE® is the source for the MeSH terms of this document.

AB  - A limited number of RCTs have shown that a good strategy for preventing the recurrence of calcium oxalate stones includes increasing fluid intake, increasing the dietary intake of calcium and restricting the intake of salt, animal protein and oxalate-rich foods. Treatment with a thiazide diuretic, allopurinol and citrate has a role in selected cases. Several other means of manipulating urinary chemistries have not been adequately tested in RCTs directed at stone prevention. © 2006 CMA Media Inc. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Introduction: No foolproof preoperative diagnostic indicators of parathyroid carcinoma (PC) exist in absence of nonskeletal metastases. Palpable parathyroid tumor, advanced skeletal and renal manifestations, and very high serum calcium and parathyroid hormone levels are considered strong predictors. Most of these features are common in Indian primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) patients although only few have PC. The aim of this study was to identify dependable clinicoinvestigative predictors of PC in Indian PHPT patients. Materials and Methods: Clinical, biochemical, radiological, and densitometric attributes of 100 PHPT patients who underwent successful parathyroidectomy (1990-2004) were studied. Various parameters of patient groups with parathyroid adenoma (n = 84), primary hyperplasia (n = 12), and carcinoma (n = 4) were compared using ANOVA, with P value < 0.05 considered significant. Results: Mean age of patients was 37.4 years, with no difference in the 3 groups (P = 0.92). Patients in 3 groups had comparably severe bone disease; 36 had coexistent renal disease. Two patients with PC and 27 (32%) with adenoma had palpable parathyroid tumor. None of the biochemical parameters predicted malignant pathology. Mean tumor weight (milligram) in carcinoma patients (15,080 ± 5,638.02) was significantly higher than those with adenoma (5,724 ± 1,257.9) (P = 0.002). Postoperative course and recovery in carcinoma patients were similar to those with adenoma. In follow-up (mean: 33 months), none of the adenoma patients were found to have persistent/recurrent PHPT attributable to missed PC. Conclusion: Indian patients with parathyroid adenoma, hyperplasia, and carcinoma were not found to differ in their clinical, biochemical, and pathological characteristics except for significantly higher tumor weight in the carcinoma group. © 2006 by the Société Internationale de Chirurgie. © 2008 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.; MEDLINE® is the source for the MeSH terms of this document.

AB  - Background: Increased dietary calcium intake has been proposed as a population-based public health intervention to prevent osteoporotic fractures. We have examined whether calcium supplementation decreases clinical fracture risk in elderly women and its mechanism of action. Methods: Five-year, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 1460 women recruited from the population and older than 70 years (mean age, 75 years) who were randomized to receive calcium carbonate, 600 mg twice per day, or identical placebo. The primary end points included clinical incident osteoporotic fractures, vertebral deformity, and adverse events ascertained in 5 years. Bone structure was also measured using dual x-ray absorptiometry of the hip and whole body, quantitative ultrasonography of the heel, and peripheral quantitative computed tomography of the distal radius. Results: Among our patients, 16.1% sustained 1 or more clinical osteoporotic fractures. In the intention-to-treat analysis, calcium supplementation did not significantly reduce fracture risk (hazard ratio, 0.87; 95% confidence interval, 0.67-1.12). However, 830 patients (56.8%) who took 80% or more of their tablets (calcium or placebo) per year had reduced fracture incidence in the calcium compared with the placebo groups (10.2% vs 15.4%; hazard ratio, 0.66; 95% confidence interval, 0.45-0.97). Calcium-treated patients had improved quantitative ultrasonography findings of the heel, femoral neck and whole-body dual x-ray absorptiometry data, and bone strength compared with placebo-treated patients. Of the 92 000 adverse events recorded, constipation was the only event increased by the treatment (calcium group, 13.4%; placebo group, 9.1%). Conclusion: Supplementation with calcium carbonate tablets supplying 1200 mg/d is ineffective as a public health intervention in preventing clinical fractures in the ambulatory elderly population owing to poor long-term compliance, but it is effective in those patients who are compliant. ©2006 American Medical Association.

AB  - This randomized, controlled trial compared the use of 1000 mg of elemental calcium with 400 international units of vitamin D3 daily versus placebo in postmenopausal women aged 50-79 years enrolled in the Women's Health Initiative trial. The follow-up period averaged approximately 7 years. In the active-treatment group, there was a small but statistically significant increase in hip-bone density, but no reduction in the overall rate of hip fracture (primary outcome) compared with the placebo group. Calcium and vitamin D3 appeared to be well tolerated, but there was an increased risk of kidney stones in women receiving treatment. © 2006 Future Medicine Ltd. © 2008 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Supersaturation is the driving force behind crystal formation in the kidneys. It can, however, result only in the formation of crystals which can be harmlessly expelled. For stone formation, crystals must form in the kidneys and be retained there, which is indeed a rare occurrence. Crystalluria is common while stone formation is not. Only pathological changes in the kidneys including renal injury and dysfunction can accomplish crystal retention. Lethal epithelial cellular injury promotes crystal nucleation, aggregation and retention. Sub-lethal injury or dysfunctional cells may produce ineffective crystallization modulators and localized areas of supersaturation in the interstitium. The former will affect crystallization in the urine while the latter may cause precipitation in the interstitium and development of Randall's plaques. © Springer-Verlag 2006. © 2011 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.; MEDLINE® is the source for the MeSH terms of this document.

AB  - Background. The authors measured urine and blood stone risk factors in African-American (AA) haemodialysis (HD) patients with new onset of stones during dialysis. Methods. Patients with nephrolithiasis (NL) newly manifested during dialysis were matched by age, sex and urine output and dialysis duration to AA HD patients without history or symptoms of stones. Two 24 h urine and serum samples were collected and analysed for conventional stone risk factors. Results. Three percent of the patients formed new stones while on HD; none had formed stones prior to end-stage renal disease. Newly onset NL patients had higher urine citrate and lower serum potassium levels than HD patients without stones. Conclusion. Usual stone risk factors did not correlate with new stones during dialysis. © 2006 Oxford University Press. © 2008 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.; MEDLINE® is the source for the MeSH terms of this document.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The efficacy of calcium with vitamin D supplementation for preventing hip and other fractures in healthy postmenopausal women remains equivocal. METHODS: We recruited 36,282 postmenopausal women, 50 to 79 years of age, who were already enrolled in a Women's Health Initiative (WHI) clinical trial. We randomly assigned participants to receive 1000 mg of elemental calcium as calcium carbonate with 400 IU of vitamin D3 daily or placebo. Fractures were ascertained for an average follow-up period of 7.0 years. Bone density was measured at three WHI centers. RESULTS: Hip bone density was 1.06 percent higher in the calcium plus vitamin D group than in the placebo group (P<0.01). Intention-to-treat analysis indicated that participants receiving calcium plus vitamin D supplementation had a hazard ratio of 0.88 for hip fracture (95 percent confidence interval, 0.72 to 1.08), 0.90 for clinical spine fracture (0.74 to 1.10), and 0.96 for total fractures (0.91 to 1.02). The risk of renal calculi increased with calcium plus vitamin D (hazard ratio, 1.17; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.02 to 1.34). Censoring data from women when they ceased to adhere to the study medication reduced the hazard ratio for hip fracture to 0.71 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.52 to 0.97). Effects did not vary significantly according to prerandomization serum vitamin D levels. CONCLUSIONS: Among healthy postmenopausal women, calcium with vitamin D supplementation resulted in a small but significant improvement in hip bone density, did not significantly reduce hip fracture, and increased the risk of kidney stones.

AB  - Chronic or persistent pain is a common comorbidity of aging, primarily due to the relatively high frequency of pain-associated disorders in this population (e.g., inflammatory and noninflammatory musculoskeletal disease, zoster infection, diabetes, stroke, and peripheral and central neurological diseases). Acetaminophen, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and opioids are important long-term analgesics in this age group. However, adjunctive agents are also important in the management of persistent pain in the elderly, especially neuropathic pain. Oral antiepileptic drugs, mexiletine, baclofen, tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin-norepinephrine dual reuptake inhibitors and intranasal/injectable calcitonin are the subjects of this review of the management of persistent, nonmalignant pain in the elderly. While some of these agents are considered narrow-spectrum analgesics (e.g., baclofen in trigeminal neuralgia and calcitonin in bone pain), most are broad-spectrum analgesics, useful in neuropathic pain syndromes of multiple etiologies. Within the antiepileptic drug class, gabapentin and carbamazepine can be considered first-line agents, followed by lamotrigine and pregabalin as second-line agents, and the other most recently approved drugs as third-line or 'salvage' agents. The tricyclic antidepressants have numerous precautionstcontraindications and tolerability issues in this population, thus reducing their utility. Duloxetine and venlafaxine are the only useful analgesics among the modern antidepressants. Challenges for the future include not only the search for more effective and less toxic adjunctive analgesics for the elderly, but also translating our knowledge of current and future analgesics into effective therapies in the 'real world' community and institutional settings where elderly people live. There is no justification in our society today for anyone to live with untreated or undertreated persistent pain. © 2006 Future Medicine Ltd. © 2008 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Objective: To report a rare case of tertiary hyperparathyroidism (HPT) as a result of long-term oral phosphate therapy. Methods: We present a case report, with a focus on clinical manifestations and biochemical findings during the course of tertiary HPT, and discuss the pathophysiologic features of this disorder and the therapeutic strategies. Results: A 35-year-old woman, 22 years after the initial diagnosis of familial hypophosphatemic rickets and initiation of treatment with phosphate and vitamin D, underwent assessment for recurrent symptomatic kidney stones, bone pain, and fatigue. Laboratory studies performed 10 months before this presentation showed findings consistent with secondary HPT. Examination was notable for short stature, and pertinent laboratory results were as follows: intact parathyroid hormone 602 pg/mL, calcium 10.9 mg/dL, and phosphorus 3.6 mg/dL. Tertiary HPT was diagnosed, and she underwent subtotal parathyroidectomy and transcervical thymectomy. Postoperatively, she had hypocalcemia and was treated with calcitriol, phosphate, and calcium carbonate; the last agent was discontinued when the serum calcium normalized. Despite multiple dosage alterations in the phosphate and calcitriol therapy, the patient had recurrent tertiary HPT and another kidney stone (treated by lithotripsy). Three years after the subtotal parathyroidectomy, treatment consisted of cinacalcet, calcitriol, and elemental phosphate. Conclusion: Long-term follow-up of patients with tertiary HPT is critical, with careful dosage adjustments in phosphate and vitamin D therapy and monitoring of serum levels of phosphorus, calcium, and parathyroid hormone. © 2006 AACE. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - In HIV-infection, therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) has been proposed to optimize highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) response. Pharmacokinetics of protease inhibitors (PI) and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI) efavirenz and nevirapine have been proved suitable for monitoring their plasma drug levels. In contrast, nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI) contain lack of a certain correlation between plasma levels and drug efficacy. Currently, TDM under HAART is limited by some uncertainty which pharmacokinetic predictor to prefer and on which drug concentration or range to rely on. In a therapy naive patient trial (ATHENA) on indinavir or nelfinavir based drug regimens, the study arm with use of TDM resulted in prevention of virological failure or treatment discontinuation due to drug toxicity. Current data ascribed increasing importance to TDM in ritonavir boosted PI combinations especially for lopinavir, atazanavir and fosamprenavir. Besides, further applications are proposed in selected patients groups (i.e. children, pregnancy, renal or hepatic dysfunction, weight loss) to confirm adequate drug concentrations and manage drug-drug- interactions. PI double-boosting in salvage regimens in patients with multiple NRTI associated mutations should also require TDM for handling dose adjustments, moreover, treatment experienced patients might benefit from TDM in combination with viral resistance testing. Limitations to the application of TDM are considered as non standardized procedures or techniques permitted to correlate pharmacological and virological data therefore, an approach towards standardization is needed. So far the inhibitory quotient (IQ) (necessitating phenotypical resistance testing) or the genotypic inhibitory quotient (GIQ) (referring to the number of viral mutations using a genotypic resistance test), could become increasingly important in this context. In assessing adherence, TDM allows to confirm the correct medication intake, but only the last few doses taken by a patient will be reflected. Without TDM, numerous interactions by co-administered drugs (antibiotics, antacid drugs, hypnotics, herbals, life-style drugs) turn out to possibly lead to obscure interpretations and individual medical care remains elusive. Currently, the interpretation of PI and NNRTI drug levels is based on increasing experience using TDM. Even though TDM in HAART is not the gold standard of care, yet, it provides security in guiding patients on an individual therapy and might be linked with pharmacogenomics in resource-rich countries. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The term channelopathies has come to describe a group of disorders caused by mutations in genes coding for cell membrane ion channels. This concept has proven valuable for classifying disorders and understanding their etiology. In the case of muscle channelopathies, it has been especially helpful in the understanding of a group of rare disorders that, on the surface, are different. However, knowledge of shared genotypes has facilitated a simpler classification and understanding of disorders such as paramyotonia congenita and periodic paralysis. The muscle diseases discussed in this section include the nondystrophic myotonias and the periodic paralyses (Table 4-1).

AB  - Hyperuricemia and secondary urate nephropathy are uncommon in the paediatric setting outside of tumour lysis syndrome. We describe the case of a 12-year-old boy who presented at 3 years of age with acute renal failure. The cause of this remained unknown until the development of uric acid renal calculi 9 years later. This, and the availability of the previously unknown family history, provided the subsequent diagnosis of partial hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) deficiency. Detailed family history is important for early detection of this heterogeneous group of disorders. Early treatment may minimise long-term renal morbidity and mortality from renal insufficiency. © IPNA 2005. © 2008 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.; MEDLINE® is the source for the MeSH terms of this document.

AB  - Heartburn is a normal consequence of pregnancy. The predominant aetiology is a decrease in lower oesophageal sphincter pressure caused by female sex hormones, especially progesterone. Serious reflux complications during pregnancy are rare; hence upper endoscopy and other diagnostic tests are infrequently needed. Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease during pregnancy should be managed with a step-up algorithm beginning with lifestyle modifications and dietary changes. Antacids or sucralfate are considered the first-line drug therapy. If symptoms persist, any of the histamine<inf>2</inf>-receptor antagonists can be used. Proton pump inhibitors are reserved for women with intractable symptoms or complicated reflux disease. All but omeprazole are FDA category B drugs during pregnancy. Most drugs are excreted in breast milk. Of systemic agents, only the histamine<inf>2</inf>-receptor antagonists, with the exception of nizatidine, are safe to use during lactation. © 2005 Blackwell Publishing Ltd. © 2008 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.; MEDLINE® is the source for the MeSH terms of this document.

AB  - Traditional antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) are associated with drug interactions and side effects that limit their safety and tolerability. Side effects of traditional AEDs are especially problematic for children and adolescents, women of childbearing age, and the elderly. Many patients with epilepsy may benefit from switching from a traditional AED to a newer agent because the newer agents are generally better tolerated and are less likely to cause drug interactions. Clinical studies have demonstrated improved therapeutic efficiency with better tolerability in patients switching from a traditional AED to lamotrigine, oxcarbazepine, or topiramate monotherapy or combination therapy. © 2005 MedReviews, LLC. © 2008 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.; MEDLINE® is the source for the MeSH terms of this document.

AB  - Purpose: We investigated the risk factors having an impact on the achievement of stone-free stains and on the success rate, as well as on the likelihood of recurrence, in patients undergoing shockwave lithotripsy. Patients and Methods: We evaluated the characteristics and outcomes of 3023 patients (3254 renal units) with upper urinary-tract stones who underwent SWL at the Funabashi Clinic over a 13-year period. We assessed the stone-free and success rates for 2844 patients (3061 renal units) 3 months post-SWL. We also determined the recurrence rate for the 1078 patients (1139 renal units) who had achieved stone-free status at that time. Results: Overall, stone-free status was achieved in 65.1% of patients, and the success rate was 85.7%. There were significant differences in the stone-free rates depending on patient age, history of urolithiasis, and presence of pyuria before SWL, as well as the number, location, size, and composition of the stones. Stones recurred in 326 of 1139 renal units (28.6%) during a mean follow-up of 36 months. The recurrence rates were 7.5%, 24.1%, and 33.0% after 1, 3, 5 years, respectively. Multiple stones, a history of urolithiasis, and stones located in the kidney or both kidneys plus the ureter significantly influenced recurrence. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that multiple stones were most significantly related to recurrence. Conclusion: Treatment with SWL has a low morbidity and high effectiveness. The number and location of stones and a history of urolithiasis significantly influence recurrence. Further studies of prophylactic therapy are required, especially for patients with these factors. © Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. © 2008 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.; MEDLINE® is the source for the MeSH terms of this document.

AB  - We compared the urothelial injury to the bladder caused by four agents capable of dissolving calcium salts. The solutions were administrated in an antegrade way through left ureterostomies in 54 rabbits for periods of 24, 48 and 72 h. The bladders were then removed and three routine histological sections were made for each. The following six solutions were used: physiological sodium chloride solution (Phys), artificial urine (Art), 0.03 M disodium EDTA buffered to pH 8.5 with triethanolamine (EDTA), 10% Renacidin (R), test solution 2 (S2, using D-gluconic acid-lactone and other compounds that differ from R in terms of ingredients or quantity), and test solution 1 (S1, using D-gluconic-acid instead of D-gluconic acid-lactone in S2 but keeping the other ingredients the same) for irrigation. At 24 h there was no observable urothelial damage caused by perfusion with Phys or Art; solutions R, S1 and S2 caused approximately the same level of injury to the rabbit bladder mucosa; however, irrigation with disodium-EDTA caused more serious urothelial injury than R, S1 and S2 (P<0.05, χ2-test) and may be unacceptable. The damage to bladder tissues treated with S1 and S2 was less than that caused by R, but this was not significant (P>0.05, χ2-test). Following a prolonged irrigation time, all of these solutions cause further urothelial damage, but EDTA caused the most, followed by R, S1, S2, Phys or Art, respectively, at 48 and 72 h. In view of the better solubility effect of solutions S1 and S2 compared with R, it might be justified in accepting the more pronounced urothelial irritation caused these solutions, but in order to enhance their effectiveness and reduce urothelial injury further study will be needed. © Springer-Verlag 2005. © 2008 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.; MEDLINE® is the source for the MeSH terms of this document.

AB  - Purpose. Critically evaluate the experimental evidence and clinical trial outcomes as the basis for use of magnesium (Mg) supplements as therapy for calcium oxalate nephrolithiasis. Materials and methods. Literature search of MedLine and Web of Science through January 2005; articles cited in papers found by searches. Results. Magnesium inhibits calcium oxalate crystallization in human urine and model systems. Magnesium also inhibits absorption of dietary oxalate from the gut lumen. Three early trials of Mg oxide (MgO) and Mg hydroxide (Mg(OH)<inf>2</inf>) reported lower rates of recurrent stone formation. However in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial with more carefully selected patients, there was no significant difference between recurrence rates with 650 or 1300 mg MgO daily and the placebo. Another trial reported 391 mg (21 meq) Mg daily as a mixed salt, Mg potassium citrate, reduced calcium stone recurrence by 90%, similar to potassium citrate, but with better gastrointestinal tolerance. The failure of MgO and Mg(OH)<inf>2</inf> as sole therapy may be related to poor absorption and low rates of Mg deficiency in the patient populations tested. Conclusions. Clinical trial evidence does not justify the use of MgO or Mg(OH)<inf>2</inf> as a sole therapy for calcium oxalate kidney stones in a general patient population. However, the addition of magnesium to potassium citrate therapy improves outcomes. Clinical trials should focus on patients who are likely to be Mg deficient. © 2008 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.; MEDLINE® is the source for the MeSH terms of this document.

AB  - The mechanism(s) by which crystals are retained in the kidney resulting in stone disease remains unclear. Intratubular aggregation as well as crystal cell binding, or internalization and translocation, or alternatively nucleation and growth in the interstitial fluid are possible models. Our group is testing the hypothesis that calcium phosphate deposits in kidneys of patients with calcium renal stones arise in unique anatomical regions of the kidney. Furthermore, we believe that their formation is conditioned by specific stone forming pathophysiologies. To test this hypothesis, we performed intra-operative renal papillary biopsies during percutaneous nephrolithotomy of kidneys from 15 idiopathic calcium stone formers as well as kidney tissue from a patient who ingested ethylene glycol, and developed a new protocol to accurately identify the composition of the calcium deposits located in the renal tissue. We developed a new histological approach that incorporated a low-energy (low-E) reflective slide substrate that has similar characteristics to a common microscope slide and infrared absorption microspectroscopy. Infrared absorption microspectroscopy revealed the crystal deposits in the idiopathic calcium oxalate stone formers to be hydroxyapatite in composition with an occasional region of calcium carbonate, while calcium oxalate was the predominant mineral in the kidney of the patient who had ingested ethylene glycol. The results demonstrate that mixed sample types containing tissue and mineralized deposits are easily analyzed while mounted on a low-E slide using the attenuated total internal reflectance (ATR) method. Reflection/absorption (R/A) analysis allows one to quickly survey a tissue section and provides qualitative information about its components. Once interesting sites have been identified by R/A analysis, ATR analysis can then be used to collect the best data possible. ATR analysis provides spectra free from many of the artifacts associated with transmission and R/A analysis, and completes the full picture of the components contained in the crystal deposits and tissue. We present a method of analysis for mineralized materials embedded in kidney tissue that uses readily or easily obtainable materials and instrumentation. The sensitivity of this method allows tissue sections to remain unstained, alleviating the tedious and time-consuming constraints of earlier methods of visual analysis. The present method will save time and training, while simultaneously offering an unbiased analysis of mineralized components that is more accurate and conducive to patient treatments than previous methods. © Springer-Verlag 2005. © 2008 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.; MEDLINE® is the source for the MeSH terms of this document.

AB  - The pace of discovery and development of new antiviral agents has increased dramatically since the 1980s. Antiviral drugs are currently available for the treatment of herpesvirus infections (HSV, VZV, CMV), respiratory virus infections (influenza A, influenza B, RSV), hepatitis virus infections (HBV, HCV), HPV infections, and HIV infections. The safety profiles of the various antiviral agents vary from drug to drug, necessitating a thorough understanding of each antiviral agent being used. Two factors that can limit the utility of antiviral drugs are toxicity and the development of antiviral resistance. The development of resistance is not a frequent issue among immunocompetent patients. Resistance most commonly develops in immunocompromised persons receiving antiviral treatment for prolonged periods. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Background: Advances in techniques have left very few indications for open surgical extraction of urinary stones currently. These advances notwithstanding, the search continues for medical approaches to urinary stone management. In this study, we perform an in vitro study analyzing the efficiency and prospect of two new complex solutions in urological calcium phosphate calculi dissolution. Methods: Eighteen stones composed mainly of calcium phosphates were taken from patients who underwent kidney stone surgery. These stones were large enough (weight range 0.514-0.928 g) to be fragmented and matched equally into six groups. Chemolysis of phosphate stones was done with six different solvents and was repeated 3 times with 6 stones for each solution. At 24, 48 and 72 h, reduction in weight, percentage weight change, and dissolution rate; the dissolution rates at pH 5.0, 7.0 and 8.5 for each solution, using different cations (Na+, K+ or Ca2+), according to different dilutions (1:1, 1:2, 1:3, 1:4) of S1 and S2 were simultaneously determined. Results: Calcium phosphate calculi were poorly dissolved by Phys and Art, and they had a low dissolution rate in pH 8.5 EDTA. The most effective solutions were S1, S2 and R, with 72 h mean dissolution rates: 5.75 ± 0.44 mg/hr (S1), 5.2 ± 0.63 mg/hr (S2), 4.55 ± 0.46 mg/hr (R) (x̄ ± s, p < 0.01 R, S1 and S2 vs Phys, Art and EDTA; p < 0.05, S1 vs R, LSD-test). The mean percentage weight loss at 72 h was: 52.1 ± 15.75 % (S1), 44.4 ± 7.37 % (S2) and 40.5 ± 3.67 % (R) (x̄ ± s, p < 0.01 R, S1 and S2 vs Phys, Art and EDTA, LSD-test). Diluted twice, S1 and S2 had even better effectiveness than their initial solution. The additive of Na+, K+ or Ca2+ greatly reduced the dissolution rates of S1, S2. Conclusion: Our data indicate that test solutions S1 and S2 are effective solvents in the chemolysis of calcium phosphate stones. At twice dilutions, these solutions are even more useful in the treatment of stone disease. © 2005 Xiang-bo et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd. © 2013 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.; MEDLINE® is the source for the MeSH terms of this document.

AB  - Background: Elderly people who have a fracture are at high risk of another. Vitamin D and calcium supplements are often recommended for fracture prevention. We aimed to assess whether vitamin D3 and calcium, either alone or in combination, were effective in prevention of secondary fractures. Methods: In a factorial-design trial, 5292 people aged 70 years or older (4481 [85%] of whom were women) who were mobile before developing a low-trauma fracture were randomly assigned 800 IU daily oral vitamin D3, 1000 mg calcium, oral vitamin D3 (800 IU per day) combined with calcium (1000 mg per day), or placebo. Participants who were recruited in 21 UK hospitals were followed up for between 24 months and 62 months. Analysis was by intention-to-treat and the primary outcome was new low-energy fractures. Findings: 698 (13%) of 5292 participants had a new low-trauma fracture, 183 (26%) of which were of the hip. The incidence of new, low-trauma fractures did not differ significantly between participants allocated calcium and those who were not (331 [12·6%] of 2617 vs 367 [13·7%] of 2675; hazard ratio (HR) 0·94 [95% CI 0·81-1·09]); between participants allocated vitamin D3 and those who were not (353 [13·3%] of 2649 vs 345 [13·1%] of 2643; 1·02 [0·88-1·19]); or between those allocated combination treatment and those assigned placebo (165 [12·6%] of 1306 vs 179 [13·4%] of 1332; HR for interaction term 1·01 [0·75- 1·36]). The groups did not differ in the incidence of all-new fractures, fractures confirmed by radiography, hip fractures, death, number of falls, or quality of life. By 24 months, 2886 (54·5%) of 5292 were still taking tablets, 451 (8·5%) had died, 58 (1·1%) had withdrawn, and 1897 (35·8%) had stopped taking tablets but were still providing data for at least the main outcomes. Compliance with tablets containing calcium was significantly lower (difference: 9·4% [95% CI 6·6-12·2]), partly because of gastrointestinal symptoms. However, potentially serious adverse events were rare and did not differ between groups. Interpretation: The findings do not support routine oral supplementation with calcium and vitamin D3, either alone or in combination, for the prevention of further fractures in previously mobile elderly people. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Intestinal resection (IR) may lead to hyperoxaluria and nephrolithiasis. A rat model of IR was developed, in which kidney stones form. We describe the urine chemistries and histopathologic features. Rats underwent resection of 40-45 cm of distal ileum (n=16) or sham resection (SR) (n=8), and were then fed a 1% Na oxalate, 0.02% Ca diet. After 1 week on the diet, 24 h urine samples were obtained for stone chemistries. At 4-7 months after surgery, kidneys were examined grossly and by light microscopy. The extent and location of crystallization was assessed by polarized light. Histochemistry and infrared spectroscopy were used to determine crystal composition. IR rats had higher urine oxalate excretion (P<0.01) and concentration (P<0.001) than SR rats, and lower urine citrate excretion; only IR rats formed kidney stones (12/15 surviving rats). Tissue calcification was found only in kidneys from IR rats, located in the cortex (83% of kidneys), medulla (73%) and papillary tip (47%). Crystals, composed of CaOx, apatite, and calcium carbonate, filled collecting duct lumens, and were associated with tubular obstruction, and interstitial inflammation. Crystals in the papillary interstitium incited inflammation with tubular destruction and development of progressive papillary erosion. This new rat model of nephrolithiasis and nephrocalcinosis resembles the pattern of urinary abnormalities and tissue calcification that may be seen in humans with small bowel resection. The model allows further studies of the mechanisms of renal crystal formation, and possible therapeutic interventions. © Springer-Verlag 2005. © 2008 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.; MEDLINE® is the source for the MeSH terms of this document.

AB  - Constipation is a common problem in children. It is also a long-term problem persisting for many months to years in children. Approximately 95% of childhood constipation is functional in nature without any obvious cause. Evaluation of a child with constipation requires a thorough history and physical examination. Hirschsprung's disease is an important cause of constipation arising in infancy and requires a thorough diagnostic evaluation and surgical treatment. Treatment of functional constipation in children requires a well-designed plan and a team approach involving the child, parents, and a health care provider. Treatment involves education of the family about constipation and encopresis, fecal disimpaction, and long-term maintenance therapy of laxatives and behavioral modification. Laxatives such as magnesium hydroxide, lactulose, and mineral oil have been used in children for a long time. A new laxative, polyethylene glycol 3350, has been used successfully in children with constipation and encopresis. Several novel therapeutic interventions have been tried for children presenting with intractable constipation, refractory to conventional treatment.

AB  - Purpose. The pharmacology, mechanisms of resistance, in vitro activity, clinical efficacy, pharmacokinetics, indications, adverse effects, dosage and administration, and place in therapy of telithromycin in the treatment of respiratory infections are reviewed. Summary. Telithromycin is the first ketolide to be approved in the United States for use against common respiratory pathogens. The unique structure of telithromycin allows for enhanced binding to bacterial ribosomal RNA, thereby blocking protein synthesis. Its spectrum of activity includes pathogens implicated in common respiratory infections (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Mycoplasma pneumonia, and Chlamydia pneumoniae) and multidrug-resistant isolates of pneumococcus. Clinical efficacy has been documented in several multicenter, comparative trials for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia, acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis, acute maxillary sinusitis, and pharyngitis tonsillitis. Although studies have demonstrated that the clinical efficacy of telithromycin is comparable to macrolides, telithromycin is unique in that it provides activity against penicillin- and macrolide-resistant respiratory pathogens. The recommended dosage of telithromycin is 800 mg p.o. once daily. The most common adverse events resulting from telithromycin use include diarrhea, nausea, headache, dizziness, vomiting, loose stools, dysgeusia, and dyspepsia. The drug's adverse-event profile is comparable to that of similar agents. Telithromycin is a strong inhibitor of cytochrome P-450 isoenzyme 3A4; therefore, it can affect the efficacy and toxicity profile of medications that are metabolized by this isoenzyme. Conclusion. Telithromycin is a reasonable addition to the current treatment options for upper-respiratory-tract infections. Its use should be restricted to infections caused by penicillin- and macrolide-resistant pathogens. Copyright © 2005, American Society of Health-System Pharmacists, Inc.

AB  - Urinary stone analysis is the most important diagnostic step after stone removal from the body. The methods employed for these analyses are based on diverse analytical principles. Chemical methods are used for detecting individual ions. Infrared spectroscopy is used for examining molecular structures, and X-ray diffraction for determination of the crystalline structure of a substance. Since 1980, a twice-yearly ring trials quality control survey has been on offer to examine the quality of urinary stone analyses. A summary of the results of 44 ring trials (1980-2001) has been compiled for individual pure substances and binary (two-component) mixtures. On average, 100 laboratories have participated in these ring trials. Initially, over 80% of the participants carried out their analyses using chemical methods. In 2001, this figure decreased to a mere 13%. In contrast, a progressive increase in the use of infrared spectroscopy was observed, up to 79% of all participants employed this method. X-Ray diffraction was only employed in a small number of specialised laboratories (5-9%). The chemical methods produced a very high proportion of errors (6.5-94%) with both the pure substances and binary mixtures, whereas high error rates for infrared spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction were confined to individual substances only. Due to the poor results in the ring trials, the majority of laboratories stopped using chemical analysis, which is now considered to be obsolete. Regarding mixtures, error rates of over 10% also occurred with infrared spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction. Ring trials are indispensable for the quality management of urinary stone analysis. © 2005 by Walter de Gruyter. © 2008 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.; MEDLINE® is the source for the MeSH terms of this document.

AB  - Potassium bicarbonate (KBC) potently reduces urine calcium excretion in adult humans, including patients with hypertension or calcium urolithiasis, and postmenopausal women. In the latter, who have substantial risk of calcium deficiency, it remains unknown whether the observed short-term urine calcium-lowering effect of KBC persists over years. We studied 170 postmenopausal women randomized to KBC 30, 60, or 90 mmol/d (KBC treatment), or placebo, for up to 36 months. Each received a multivitamin with 400 IU vitamin D, and calcium carbonate as needed to produce a total dietary calcium intake of at least 30 mmol daily. Daily urine calcium excretion (UCaV) did not differ among groups at baseline (all-groups mean ± SD, 155 ± 83 mg/d). From 1-36 months of KBC treatment, adjusting UCaV for creatinine (Cr) excretion, each dose of KBC reduced UCaV (P < 0.01) with a dose-dependent trend (P = 0.05). The reduced UCaV/Cr persisted throughout the KBC treatment period (up to 36 months) in all KBC, and the greatest reductions occurred in the subjects with greatest baseline UCaV/Cr (ΔUCaV/Cr vs. baseline UCaV/Cr; P < 0.001). Twenty-eight percent of the subjects had high baseline calciuria (UCaV/Cr > 200 mg Ca/1000 mg Cr). With baseline UCaV/Cr of 250 mg/1000 mg Cr, KBC 60 mmol decreased UCaV/Cr by 55.8 mg/1000 mg Cr, a potential daily calcium retention that over a 36-month period would accumulate up to 55,845 mg of calcium, nearly 5% of bone calcium content. KBC treatment induced a dose-dependent decrease in UCaV/Cr that persisted up to 36 months, with the greatest decreases occurring in those women with the greatest baseline UCaV, nearly a third of whom had high baseline calciuria. Thus, one can preselect postmenopausal women most likely to have the urine calcium-lowering effect of KBC and predict their potential bone calcium increase. © 2010 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.; MEDLINE® is the source for the MeSH terms of this document.

AB  - Renal stones have afflicted humans for millennia but there is still no solution to this problem. This review discusses the laboratory and metabolic aspects of the clinical management of patients with renal stones, both primary and secondary in origin. First, non-pharmacological interventions such as increased fluid intake, decreased protein consumption, dietary changes in sodium, calcium, oxalate, potassium, purine, vitamins, and essential fatty acids are considered. Then specific pharmacological treatment to modify urine calcium, oxalate, urate, citrate, and acidity are considered. Finally, more unusual types of stone are examined. © 2008 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - A 17-year-old gelding was evaluated because of dysuria, inappetence, and weight loss. Cystoscopy revealed severe mucosal ecchymoses with luminal hemorrhage and accumulations of crystalloid sludge. Analysis of a urine sample revealed isosthenuria, an alkaline pH, pyuria, hematuria, bacteriuria, and numerous calcium carbonate crystals. Histologic examination of bladder mucosa biopsy specimens revealed severe neutrophilic infiltration with mineralization. A diagnosis of encrusted cystitis exacerbated by sabulous urolithiasis was made. A Corynebacterium sp susceptible to penicillin, sulfonamide, and enrofloxacin was cultured from the urine and the bladder mucosa biopsy specimens. The horse was treated with penicillin G potassium, IV, for 5 days, followed by trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for 4 weeks. Bladder lavage was performed daily for the first 3 days with a balanced electrolyte solution and dimethyl sulfoxide in an attempt to aid expulsion of necrotic debris and crystalline sludge from the bladder. Molecular phylogenetic analysis based on the 16S rDNA gene sequence was used to identify the isolate and determine its phylogenetic position. Results indicated that the isolate was closely related to Corynebacterium matruchotii. To our knowledge, encrusted cystitis secondary to C matruchotii has not been previously identified in a horse. © 2008 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.; MEDLINE® is the source for the MeSH terms of this document.

However, elevated levels of serum CA 125 have also been detected in other benign and malignant disorders. This study describes a haemodialysis patient who contracted tuberculous peritonitis associated with hypercalcaemia, erythropoietin-resistant anaemia and elevated CA 125, which normalised gradually following antituberculosis treatment. Tuberculous peritonitis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of ascites with elevated serum CA 125. Additionally, CA 125 is a useful marker for monitoring response to tuberculous peritonitis treatment. © Blackwell Publishing Ltd, 2005. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Objectives: To establish the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of selective oestrogen receptor modulators, bisphosphonates and parathyroid hormone (subject to licensing) for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis and the prevention of osteoporotic fractures in postmenopausal women. Data sources: Electronic databases. Review methods: Studies that met the review's entry criteria were eligible for inclusion in the meta-analyses provided that they reported fracture incidence in terms of the number of patients suffering fractures. Meta-analysis was carried out using the random-effects model. A model was constructed to estimate the cost-effectiveness of osteoporosis interventions. The model calculated the number of fractures that occurred and provided the costs associated with osteoporotic fractures, and the quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). In addition, the conditions of breast cancer and coronary heart disease (CHD) were modelled, as some interventions have been shown to affect the risk of these conditions. Results: Ninety randomised controlled trials (RCTs) met the inclusion criteria. They related to the five interventions (alendronate, etidronate, risedronate, raloxifene and teriparatide) and to five comparators (calcium, calcium plus vitamin D, calcitriol, hormone replacement therapy and exercise), as well as placebo or no treatment. All five interventions have been shown to reduce the risk of vertebral fracture in women with severe osteoporosis with adequate calcium intakes. However, none of these drugs has been demonstrated, by direct comparison, to be significantly more effective than either each other or the other active interventions reviewed in this report. The intervention costs of treating all osteoporotic women, for a period of 5 years, were in the region of £900-1500 million for alendronate, etidronate, risedronate and raloxifene. The cost per QALY ratios fell dramatically with age. Assuming the risks of a woman with severe osteoporosis at the threshold of osteoporosis, no treatment had a cost per QALY below £35,000 at 50 years of age. At 60 years of age, the cost per QALY of raloxifene was £26,000 assuming no impact on hip fractures, and £31,000 assuming an adverse effect. However, these results are driven by the effect on breast cancer and the assumptions made regarding this disease state. No other intervention had a cost per QALY below £35,000. When analyses were conducted assuming that the fracture risk is doubled at each site, alendronate and risedronate had cost per QALY ratios below £30,000 at all ages. For women at the threshold of osteoporosis, without a prior fracture and aged 70 years, the cost per QALY of the three bisphosphonates ranged from £34,000 to £41,000. Raloxifene had a cost per QALY of £23,000, assuming no effect on hip fracture, given assumptions regarding breast cancer. At 80 years of age, the cost per QALY of alendronate and risedronate was below £20,000. This was true for etidronate when incorporating observational data, but the value rose to £69,000 when only RCT data were used. No other intervention had a cost per QALY below £35,000. It was assumed that doubling the risk of fracture for women without a prior fracture would give results similar to patients at the threshold of osteoporosis with a prior fracture. Conclusions: Of the five interventions, only raloxifene appeared to reduce the risk of vertebral fracture in postmenopausal women unselected for low bone mineral density (BMD). However, as the full data have not been made public, there is some uncertainty regarding this result. None of the five interventions has been shown to reduce the risk of non-vertebral fracture in women unselected for low BMD. All of the proposed interventions provided gains in QALYs compared with no treatment in women with sufficient calcium and vitamin D intakes. The size of the QALY gain for each intervention was strongly related to the age of the patient. The estimated costs varied widely for the interventions. These net costs were markedly different by age, with some interventions becoming cost-saving at higher age ranges in patients with a prior fracture. Areas for future research include: the evidence base for the efficacy of fracture prevention in the very elderly, reanalysis of raloxifene using a dedicated breast cancer and CHD model, and more trials considering the cost-effectiveness of teriparatide. © Queen's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2005.

AB  - Altered bile flow physiology leads to many complications commonly seen in patients with cholestatic liver disease, regardless of the etiology. For each individual patient, a coordinated and effective treatment strategy must address the presence and the severity spectrum of malabsorption, malnutrition, vitamin and micronutrient deficiencies, pruritus, xanthomata, ascites, and liver failure, which are attributed directly or indirectly to diminished bile flow. An aggressive approach to maximizing the nutritional status of the child is vital to ensure optimal growth and development. Protein-calorie and/or fat supplementation is best discussed early. Decreasing the percentage of dietary long-chain triglycerides, providing medium-chain triglycerides, and ensuring adequate essential fatty acid and adequate protein intake may be helpful. Fat-soluble vitamin (A, D, E, and K) levels and micronutrient levels must be carefully and serially monitored and supplemented as necessary. Because the mechanisms that mediate pruritus of cholestasis remain to be determined, the use of empirical therapies continues to be standard practice. Ursodeoxycholic acid may ameliorate pruritus. Antihistamines and rifampicin may also provide temporary relief for some children. Based on the evidence that increased central opioidergic tone is present in chronic cholestasis, the use of opiate antagonists is promising but has not been evaluated in children. Selected patients with refractory pruritus that have failed maximal medical therapy have benefited from partial external biliary diversion. Ongoing dialogue with the family regarding the indications for liver transplantation is reasonable. Optimization and adherence with the pretransplant medical management enhance the chances for a successful outcome from liver transplantation. Specific to the pediatric patient, optimizing growth, development and nutrition, minimizing discomfort and disability, and aiding the child and family in coping with the stress, social, and emotional effects of chronic liver disease remain paramount.

AB  - To date, 25 antiretroviral agents (including fixed-dose combinations) have gained approval by the Food and Drug Administration and are currently available on the market for the treatment of HIV-1 infection. New protease inhibitors, atazanavir sulfate (Reyataz) and fosamprenavir (Lexiva), were licensed, in addition to the nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) emtricitabine (Emtriva) and 2 fixed-dose NRTI combinations, emtricitabine/ tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (Truvada) and lamivudine/abacavir (Epzicom). These newly licensed antiretroviral agents allow for lower pill burden and dosing schedule simplification, and some agents such as atazanavir sulfate are associated with improved lipid profile in comparison to other currently marketed protease inhibitors. In addition, a new class of antiretroviral agents, entry inhibitors, of which a subclass exists called fusion inhibitors with its representative member, enfuvirtide (Fuzeon), which is currently the only available drug in its class, was marketed almost 2 years ago. Despite a remarkable progress in the treatment of HIV infection noted during the past decade, significant challenges to therapy such as tolerability issues and emergence of drug-resistant strains remain. Therefore, new antiretroviral drug development has focused on a design of drugs that work against the resistant strains of HIV and/or have a novel mechanism of action. © 2005 Sage Publications. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Calcinosis, or dystrophic soft-tissue calcification, occurs in damaged or devitalized tissues in the presence of normal calcium/phosphorus metabolism. It is often noted in the subcutaneous tissues of connective tissues diseases - primarily systemic lupus erythematosus, scleroderma, or dermatomyositis - and may involve a relatively localized area or be widespread. The calcinotic accumulations may lead secondarily to muscle atrophy, joint contractures, and skin ulceration complicated by recurrent episodes of local inflammation and infection. OBJECTIVES: To review the classification, pathogenesis, clinical features, and treatment of calcinosis in rheumatic diseases. METHOD: A MEDLINE search of articles from 1972 to 2004 was conducted utilizing the index word "calcinosis" with the coindexing terms "scleroderma," "lupus," "dermatomyositis," and "dystrophic calcification." RESULTS: Calcinosis may be the source of both pain and disability in connective tissue disease patients. Illustrative cases of patients with severe calcinosis are described. The literature available was critically reviewed. While warfarin, colchicine, probenecid, bisphosphonates, diltiazem, minocycline, aluminum hydroxide, salicylate, surgical extirpation, and carbon dioxide laser therapies have been used, no treatment has convincingly prevented or reduced calcinosis. CONCLUSIONS: Calcinosis is common in the conditions reviewed and a number of agents have been used for treatment. However, the approach to calcinosis management is disorganized, beginning with the lack of a generally accepted classification and continuing with a lack of systematic study and clinical therapeutic trials. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Active Absorbable Algal Calcium (AAA Ca) is made by submaximally (800 degrees ) heating cleaned oyster shell under reduced pressure and mixing it with similarly heated seaweed (Cystophyllum fusiforme). AAA Ca, the best absorbed from the intestine than other available calcium compounds, consequently most efficiently suppresses parathyroid hormone secretion, increases bone mineral density and decreases vertebral fracture. Aging is associated with calcium deficiency, mostly because of the decreased biosynthesis of 1,25 (OH)2 vitamin D in the kidney. Parathyroid hormone consequently increases, contributing to various diseases associated with aging such as osteoporosis or decrease of calcium in the bone, as well as hypertension, arteriosclerosis, Alzheimer's disease and osteoarthritis due to paradoxical increase of calcium in vascular walls, brain, cartilage and intracellular compartment of many kinds of cells. Mild calcium deficiency is hard to detect despite these serious consequences because of the remarkable constancy of blood calcium concentration maintained by elaborate homeostatic control. Only by successfully counteracting calcium deficiency by AAA Ca with outstanding absorbability, the phenomenon of calcium paradox becomes a recognizable reality within our reach.

AB  - The incidence of nephrolithiasis in industrialized countries is 0.5% to 1% annually. Stone formers subsequently face recurrence rates of 50% over 5 years. Annual costs in the United States for evaluation and treatment have been estimated at $1.83 billion USD [Clark JY, Thompson IM, Optenburg SA. Economic impact of urolithiasis in the United States. J Urol 1995;154:2020-2024]. Clearly the impact of urinary stone management poses an ever increasing medical, economic and social burden to modern society. The ability to detect 97% of underlying medical abnormalities in stone forming patients has stimulated discoveries of both selective and non-selective medical therapies to prevent stone recurrence. And yet there is no clear evidence in the literature that medical prophylaxis is cost effective. Various studies support the cost effectiveness of both proponents and adversaries of medical stone management. Nevertheless, there is clear evidence that medical therapy effectively prevents stone formation, especially when analyzing surrogate endpoints such as 24 urinary abnormalities, as well as primary endpoints such as stone formation. Therefore it makes intuitive sense to offer a search for underlying metabolic abnormalities in stone-forming patients and subsequently provide medical therapy, if the patient desires. Herein, we provide an overview in the medical evaluation and medical management of urinary stone disease. © Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Formation of calculi in efferent urinary passages is always due to supersaturation of urinary calculi substances and associated increased crystallization. Apart from the typical calculi, consisting of calcium oxalate, inorganic phosphates, uric acid or cystine, there are occasional signs of rare substance classes. Although more than 50 silicate stones have already been reported internationally, this stone entity remains relatively unknown. In particular, the occurrence of silicate stones in the absence of magnesium trisilicate abuse is extremely rare. A medium-sized left-sided ureterolith was removed from a 54-year-old male patient using a ureteroscope. X-ray diffraction showed it to be a compound stone consisting of 40% silicate. The patient, who in 1986 was living close to the nuclear reactor accident in Chernobyl, showed no signs of a constant uptake of magnesium trisilicate. However, he had undergone partial (2/3) gastrectomy 4 months before for a drug-refractory gastric ulcer, which had been diagnosed at the end of the 1980s and treated with excessive dosages of a magnesium trisilicate antacid preparation until the time of the operation. The patient had also been suffering from unstable angina pectoris since 1986 and treated with Pentalong (pentaerythrityltetranitrate) for 17 years. We were also able to detect silicium dioxide in components of this drug using X-ray diffraction. Silicate uroliths are extremely rare but they can be clearly identified by X-ray diffraction or infrared spectroscopy and distinguished from artifacts or quartz pebbles. Formation of calculi can be prevented by increasing diuresis as well as switching to a different drug and reducing the dosage. © 2008 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.; MEDLINE® is the source for the MeSH terms of this document.

AB  - Background. Although some information is available regarding the cellular/molecular changes in immune system exposed to microgravity, little is known about the reasons of the increase in the kidney stone formation in astronauts during and/or after long duration missions at zero gravity (0g). In our earlier studies, we have assessed a unique agent, nanobacteria (NB), in kidney stones and hypothesized that NB have an active role in calcium phosphate-carbonate deposition in kidney. In this research we studied effect of microgravity on multiplication and calcification of NB in vitro. Methods. We examined NB cultures in High Aspect Rotating Vessels (HARVs) designed at the NASA's Johnson Space Center, which are designed to stimulate some aspects of microgravity. Multiplication rate and calcium phosphate composition of those NB were compared with NB cultured on stationary and shaker flasks. Collected aliquots of the cultures from different incubation periods were analyzed using spectrophotometer, SEM, TEM, EDX, and x-ray diffraction techniques. Results. The results showed that NB multiplied 4.6x faster in HARVs compared to stationary cultures, and 3.2x faster than shaker flask conditions. X-ray diffraction and EDX analysis showed that the degree of apatite crystal formation and the properties of the apatite depend on the specific culture conditions used. Conclusion. We now report an increased multiplication rate of NB in microgravity-simulated conditions. Thus, NB infection may have a potential role in kidney stone formation in crew members during space flights. For further proof to this hypothesis, screening of the NB antigen and antibody level in flight crew before and after flight would be necessary. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Less bone loss occurs when calcium intake is adequate. Calcium therapy can increase bone mineral density by 1.5 to 2%. Most studies revealing a reduced fracture rate with antiresorptive agents included concomitant calcium supplementation. Calcium absorption occurs predominantly in the upper small bowel under the control of 1,25 hydroxyvitamin D. Adequate vitamin D intake should be ensured, especially in winter or when minimal sun exposure occurs such as being housebound or fully clad. Because the absorption ability of the bowel becomes saturated with calcium doses greater than 500 mg, calcium supplementation should occur with doses of 500 mg or less given more frequently throughout the day. The Institute of Medicine states adequate calcium intakes are 500 to 800 mg for young children, 1300 mg for adolescents, and 1200 mg for adults 51 yr and older. Glucocorticoid therapy generally necessitates higher calcium intakes. The main dietary calcium sources are dairy products, but more foods and beverages, such as cereals, orange juice, and soy milk, are calcium fortified. Because most Americans of all ages ingest insufficient dietary calcium daily, almost everyone could use calcium supplementation. Calcium carbonate contains 40% calcium with optimal absorption occurring with food. Calcium citrate contains 21% calcium and its absorption is independent of food intake. Calcium administration should not be given at the same time as bisphosphonates, quinolones, or thyroid replacement. The most common side effect is constipation, which generally resolves with increased water, fiber, and exercise, but sometimes requires a lower calcium dose. © Copyright 2004 by Humana Press Inc.

AB  - Kidney stones are the result of a complex interaction of hereditary and environmental factors. They are an increasingly common affliction of industrialized societies. In nearly all cases, kidney stone formation can be drastically reduced or prevented if the patient adheres closely to a carefully designed prevention program.

AB  - Drug-induced nephrolithiasis represents 1-2% of all renal calculi. The drugs reported to produce calculi may be divided into two groups. The first one includes poorly soluble drugs with high urine excretion that favours crystallization in the urine. Among poorly soluble molecules, triamterene was the leading cause of drug-containing nephrolithiasis in the 1970s. In the last decade, drugs used for the treatment of HIV-infected patients as indinavir and sulfadiazine, have become the most frequent cause of drug-containing nephrolithiasis. Besides these drugs, about twenty other molecules may induce nephrolithiasis in patients receiving long-term treatment or high doses. Calculi analysis by physical methods, including infrared spectroscopy, is needed to demonstrate the presence of the drug or its metabolites within the calculi. The second group includes drugs that provoke nephrolithiasis as a consequence of their metabolic effects. The incidence of such calculi, especially those resulting from calcium/vitamin D supplementation, is probably underestimated. © 2008 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To contrast available once-daily antiretroviral agents and combinations of these agents from a clinical pharmacologic viewpoint. DATA SOURCES: Data were extracted from publications and major HIV conference proceedings cited in MEDLINE (1966-March 2004) using the search terms antiretroviral therapy, combination therapy, once-daily therapy, and pharmacokinetics. Additional references were obtained from the bibliographies of these sources. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: Information pertaining to pharmacologic perspectives for once-daily antiretroviral agents was selected. DATA SYNTHESIS: Maximal and durable suppression of plasma HIV RNA, the principal goal of therapy, depends on the intrinsic antiviral activity of the antiretroviral regimen. A favorable tolerability/toxicity profile is also fundamentally important. All once-daily agents exhibit some pharmacologic limitations or lack adequate long-term follow-up. Of available agents, efavirenz has a long and distinguished efficacy record, with reasonable safety and moderate tolerability. Lamivudine, and newer agents such as atazanavir (or atazanavir/ritonavir), emtricitabine, fosamprenavir/ritonavir, and tenofovir, may offer pharmacologic advantages in the current state of once-daily therapy. Important considerations exist for coadministering once-daily agents including drug-drug interactions, drug-food incompatibilities, and synergistic toxicities. Few controlled studies have compared once-daily regimens with conventional regimens. CONCLUSIONS: Progress has been made toward once-daily therapy, but more clinical experience with available agents is needed, including comparative studies of entirely once-daily regimens versus conventional regimens. Limitations of currently available agents signify a need for improved antiretroviral utilization or new alternative agents. © 2008 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.; MEDLINE® is the source for the MeSH terms of this document.

AB  - Urolithiasis in sows and neonatal pigs is well-known, but information on its occurrence and impact in finishing pigs is sparse. This study reports three outbreaks of urolithiasis in finishing pigs. In one herd, no symptoms were observed, whereas in the other herds the presence of calculi caused obstruction of the urinary tract resulting in death. Using infra-red spectroscopy, the predominant mineral-type found in the uroliths was calcium carbonate (calcite). Only small amounts of calcium oxalate (<1%) could be detected. A high urinary pH, small abnormalities in the mineral composition of the feed and insufficient drinking water were the most important risk factors identified. To prevent urolithiasis, it is important to ensure adequate water intake, to provide a balanced mineral diet, and to avoid urinary tract infections. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A 19-year-old woman with recurrent lithiasis was admitted to the urology department for renal colic. Although radiologic examinations and laboratory tests were negative, the patient regularly brought into consultations small "stones", resembling gravel, that she said had been spontaneously expelled. These 42 samples were the object of a preliminary morphological analysis under a binocular magnifier to detect their paniculate components. A non-metabolic origin was suspected from the organoleptic characteristics of their surfaces and sections. In view of the diversity of the materials of these apparently false calculi, methods of precise physical analysis were necessary to ascertain their exact origin and thereby confirm the diagnosis of factitious lithiasis. The use of two methods of physical analysis, infrared spectrophotometry and x-ray diffraction, enabled us to determine their exact chemical and mineralogical composition. The samples claimed to be of urinary origin actually consisted of exogenous products of various compositions. Some samples were made of pure calcite, others of mixed calcite and silicates. Moreover several samples of the patient's first morning urine showed no correlation between the nature of the crystalluria and the composition of these stones. These tests made it possible to direct the clinician towards useful complementary investigations. This strange case represents 0.1% of the urinary calculi analysed in Western Algeria. © 2008 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.; MEDLINE® is the source for the MeSH terms of this document.

AB  - Background. Angiotensin II (ang II) receptor subtype I binding sites has been recently demonstrated on bone cell precursors. Ang II stimulates DNA and collagen synthesis in human adult bone cells. The aim of this study is to evaluate the role of renin angiotensin system in the bone metabolism and to address the genetic influence of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) gene polymorphism on bone mass in hemodialysis patients. Methods. Forty-eight end-stage renal disease patients (28 male, 20 female mean age 42±13 years,) on maintenance hemodialysis were included in the study. Bone mineral density (BMD) was estimated at lumbar spine and T score worse than -1.5 were considered as osteopenia. Serum parathyroid hormone (iPTH) and osteocalcin (OC), bone alkaline phosphatase (bAP) and carboxy terminal propeptide type 1 collagen (PICP) levels were measured as markers of bone metabolism. Plasma renin activity (PRA), serum ACE activity and ACE gene polymorphism (II, ID, DD) were determined. Results. Bone mineral density and T score of the hemodialysis patients were 0.92±0.17 g/cm2 and -1.36± 1.50, respectively. Twenty-one patients (43,7%) were osteopenic (T score worse than -1.5) and mean T score of osteopenic patients was -2.72±0.72. T score of nonosteopenic group was -0.29±0.99. Serum calcium, serum, phosphorus, serum OC, serum bAP, serum PCIP, serum PTH levels were similar in osteopenics and nonosteopenics. No difference was observed in predialysis PRA and in both pre- and postdialysis serum ACE activity of patients in both groups. PRA after hemodialysis in nonosteopenic group was higher than osteopenics (p<0.05). Percent increment in PRA in hemodialysis patients was correlated with T score (R=0.48 p <0.05). Serum ACE activity was positively correlated with serum iPTH (R=0.29, p=0.02), serum OC (R=0.35, p=0.01), serum bAP (R=0.34, p=0.01), serum PCIP (R=0.36, p=0.01). T score (-0.7±1.5, vs -1.7±1.3 p <0.05) was higher in DD group (n = 19) compared to II+ID group (n=29). Conclusions. Association of biochemical and radiological signs of increased bone formation with activated RAS in hemodialysis patients might be an evidence for the involvement of this system in the regulation of bone metabolism. © 2009 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.; MEDLINE® is the source for the MeSH terms of this document.

AB  - Uric acid stones occur in 10% of all kidney stones and are the second most-common cause of urinary stones after calcium oxalate and calcium phosphate calculi. The most important risk factor for uric acid crystallization and stone formation is a low urine pH (below 5.5) rather than an increased urinary uric acid excretion. Main causes of low urine pH are tubular disorders (including gout), chronic diarrhea or severe dehydration. Uric acid stone disease can be prevented and these are one of the few urinary tract stones that can be dissolved successfully. The treatment of uric acid stones consists not only of hydration (urine volume above 2000 ml daily), but mainly of urine alkalinization to pH values between 6.2 and 6.8. Urinary alkalization with potassium citrate or sodium bicarbonate is a highly effective treatment, resulting in dissolution of existing stones. Urinary uric acid excretion can be reduced by a low-purine diet. Potassium citrate is the treatement of choice for the prevention of recurrence of uric acid calculi. Allopurinol reduces the frequency of stone formation in hyperuricosuric patients with recurrent uric acid stones and/or gout. © 2008 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Constipation is a common problem in children. It is also a long-term problem persisting for many years, and beyond adolescence in about a third of children. Approximately 95% of childhood constipation is functional in nature without any obvious cause. Treatment of functional constipation in children requires a well-designed plan and a 'team approach' involving the child, parents, and a health-care provider. Treatment involves education of the family about constipation and encopresis, fecal disimpaction, and long-term maintenance therapy of laxatives and behavioral modification. Laxatives such as magnesium hydroxide (Milk of magnesia®, Philips) lactulose, and mineral oil have been used in children for a long time. Recently a new laxative, polyethyleneglycol 3350 has been used successfully in children with constipation and encopresis. New prokinetic agents have been tried in adults with constipation and may be available for children in the future. 2004 © Future Drugs Ltd. © 2008 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - A 76 year-old man presented with voiding difficulties and urethral pain. There were calculi at external meatus and at prostate on digital rectal examination and pelvic X-ray. He underwent meatotomy and transurethral extirpation of urethral and prostate stones. Endoscopically the prostate fossa was cavitated like as post-prostatectomy while partially the cavity was lining with urotherial mucosal bridge. Prostatic calculi were situated in the fossa. Postoperative voiding cystourethrography and retrograde urethrography showed that vesical neck function was competent, which was different from that seen after prostatectomy and there was no functional and mechanical obstruction in the urethra. The calculi were made of calcium phosphate (75%) and calcium carbonate (25%). This constitution is more common in prostatic calculus than urethral stone. Prostatic calculus per se does not cause lower urinary tract symptoms in most cases. However, we recommend the transurethral extirpation of large prostatic calculi which substantially cause lower urinary tract symptom. © 2012 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Renal tubular epithelium is the major target for oxalate induced injury, and sustained hyperoxaluria together with CaOx crystal formation/deposition may induce renal tubular cell damage and/or dysfunction. This may express itself in cell apoptosis. To evaluate the possible protective effects of certain agents (vitamin E, potassium citrate, allopurinol, verapamil and MgOH) on the presence and the severity of apoptotic changes caused by hyperoxaluria on renal tubular epithelium, an experimental study in rabbits was performed. Seventy rabbits were divided into seven different groups (each group n = 10): in group I severe hyperoxaluria was induced by continuous ethylene glycol (0.75%) administration started on day 0 and completed on day 14. Histologic alterations including crystal formation together with apoptotic changes (by using the TUNEL method) were evaluated on days 21 and 42, respectively. In the remaining experimental groups (groups II-VI), animals received some agents in addition to the induction of hyperoxaluria in an attempt to limit apoptotic changes. Group VII) animals constituted the controls. Kidneys were examined histopathologically under light microscopy for the presence and degree of crystal deposition in the tubular lumen. The percentage of apoptotic nuclei in the control group was significantly different from the other group animals (2.9-2.4%) in all study phases (P < 0.05). Apart from potassium citrate and allopurinol, the other medications seemed to prevent or limit the formation of apoptotic changes in renal tubular epithelium during the early period (day 21). The percentage of positively stained nuclei in animals undergoing potassium citrate medication ranged from 24.3% to 28.6%, with an average of 27.1%. This was 18.4% in animals receiving allopurinol. On the other hand, animals receiving magnesium hydroxide (MgOH), verapamil and vitamin E demonstrated limited apoptotic changes (11.2, 9.7, 8.7%, respectively) during this phase(P < 0.05). In the long-term (day 42), the animals receiving allopurinol and eitamine E showed a decrease in the percentage of the positively stained nuclei (13.5% and 8.3%, respectively). Animals in the other groups showed an increase in the number and percentage of apoptotic cells. Although, there was a significant decrease in the mean values of apoptosis in animals receiving vitamine E (8.7%-8.3%) and allopurinol (18.4%-13.5%) (P < 0.05), animals on verapamil, MgOH and potassium citrate medication had an increase in these values or the change was not found to be significant. In the light of our findings and results from the literature, it is clear that that both hyperoxaluria and CaOx crystals may be injurious to renal epithelial cells. Apoptotic changes observed in renal tubular epithelial cells induced by massive hyperoxaluria might result in cell degradation and may play a role in the pathologic course of urolithiasis. Again, as demonstrated in our study, the limitation of both crystal deposition and apoptotic changes might be instituted by some antioxidant agents as well as urinary inhibitors. Clinical application of such agents in the prophylaxis of stone disease might limit the formation of urinary calculi, especially in recurrent stone formers. © 2008 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.; MEDLINE® is the source for the MeSH terms of this document.

AB  - Nephrolithiasis is a complex, multifactorial disease resulting from an interaction between environmental and genetic factors. A minority of patients form stones because of well defined systemic diseases. In the rest, who usually are otherwise well expected for stone formation, the pathogenesis of stone is not as cleary defined. Compressive metabolic evaluation has become an important aspect of the management of recurrent nephrolithiasis, yet the role of stone analysis is often neglected or perhaps underestimated. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the chemical composition of kidney and biliary stones in our patients in order to provide guidance in metabolic evaluation and medical diagnosis, therapeutic treatment and prevention of recurrence. We used infrared spectroscopic method (Perkin Elmer Infrared Spectroscopy) to analyze the chemical composition of 224 kidney stones passed spontaneously or removed surgically and 40 gallstones removed surgically in the »Mother Teresa« University Hospital Centre of Tirana. Of 224 kidney stones 62% belong to male and 38% to female patients. Of infrared spectroscopic examinations of kidney stones 75.4% of results are calcium oxalate (CaOx) stones, 12.5% uric acid (UA) stones, 10.3% phosphate stones and 1.8% cystine stones. Of CaOx stones 67.4% are pure CaOx stones and 32.6% are mixed composition stones (CaOx mixed with UA or apatite). Of UA stones 82.1% are pure UA stones, 10.7% are UA stones mixed with ammonium urate and 7.2% are pure ammonium urate stones. Of phosphate stones 39.1% are of struvite composition, 26.1% are of carabapatite composition and 34.8% are of struvite composition mixed with apatite. The incidence of CaOx stones, UA stones and cystine stones is higher in men, while phosphate stones predominate in women. The chemical composition of 40 biliary stones examined with infrared spectroscopy is the following: 2.5% are pure calcium bilirubinate stones, are 42.5% are pure cholesterol stones and 55% are mixed stones (cholesterol stones mixed with calcium bilirubinate, calcite, aragonite or apatite). Females predominate in bilary stones. Calcium stones are the most frequent kidney stones. Calcium stones, uric acid stones and cystine stones were found more frequently in males than in females. On the other hand, phosphate containing stones, very often called »infection stones«, were more frequent in female patients. Cholesterol stones predominate in gallstones examined by infrared spectroscopy. All types of gallstones are more frequent in women than in men. Stone analysis alone may provide guidance for therapeutic treatment and recurrence prevention. © 2008 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Poor tolerability is a major cause of nonadherence and treatment discontinuation with protease inhibitors (Pis). Gastrointestinal (GI) disturbances are often cited as affecting PI tolerability, but other adverse effects, such as those that affect patient appearance or self-perception, can also negatively impact patient acceptance and adherence to or continuation of therapy. Long-term complications-such as lipodystrophy, hyperlipidemia, and insulin resistance-can deter patients from beginning therapy or discourage them from continuing therapy once it is begun. Data regarding these issues in the context of older PIs have helped define the limitations of these first-generation agents, but addressing concerns of the safety and tolerability associated with newer PIs is critical to ensuring the continued viability of the class. The new PIs atazanavir (ATV) and fosamprenavir (FPV; formerly GW-433908, or "908") have each been shown to offer improved GI tolerability and favorable lipid profiles. However, each is associated with unique traits of safety and tolerability that may differentially affect their clinical utility. Less is known about the safety and tolerability profiles of two newer PIs, tipranavir (TPV) and TMC-114, although both of these agents have shown promising results in PI-experienced patients to date. Improved safety and tolerability are important goals for the development of new PIs, which, if met, may lead to increased utilization of PIs in the management of HIV infection. This article summarizes the limitations that have been associated with PI-including therapy over the past several years and outlines how newer PIs may shape management schemes for those living with HIV infection through improved safety and tolerability. © 2008 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - During the last 2 decades in Germany, only minor efforts were expended for the prevention of urinary stones. Substantial technical progress simplified the treatment of existing calculi; thus, it was more convenient to treat a new stone than to prevent its recurrence. But times change! In these days of financial squeeze in the medical system, prevention becomes more attractive. Nevertheless, strategies for kidney stone prevention developed. Established concepts for dietary advice were rejected due to the results of new randomized studies. Moreover, new pharmacological substances were introduced for metaphyalxis. The new concepts are feasible for the daily routine. For some treatment modalities in stone prevention, there is valid evidence from the literature, which should encourage us to adopt these modalities in the future. A number of drugs are used as "good common practice" without any proof from a randomized trial. Often prospective and valid studies are not available. The present paper intends to describe the status quo of nephrolithiasis prevention in Germany, focussing on confirmed data and unsolved problems. © 2008 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.; MEDLINE® is the source for the MeSH terms of this document.

AB  - Drug-induced calculi represent 1-2% of all renal calculi. The drugs reported to produce calculi formation may be divided into two groups. The first one includes poorly soluble drugs with high urine excretion that favours crystallisation in the urine. Among poorly soluble molecules, triamterene was the leading cause of drug-containing urinary calculi in the 1970s, and it is still currently responsible for a significant number of calculi. In the last decade, drugs used for the treatment of HIV-infected patients, namely indinavir and sulfadiazine, have become the most frequent cause of drug-containing urinary calculi. Besides these drugs, about twenty other molecules may induce nephrolithiasis in patients receiving long-term treatment or high doses. Calculi analysis by physical methods, including infrared spectroscopy or x-ray diffraction, is needed to demonstrate the presence of the drug or its metabolites within the calculi. The second group includes drugs that provoke urinary calculi as a consequence of their metabolic effects. Here, diagnosis relies on careful clinical inquiry because physical methods are ineffective to differentiate between urinary calculi induced by the metabolic effects of a drug and common metabolic calculi. The incidence of such calculi, especially those resulting from calcium/vitamin D supplementation, is probably underestimated. Although drug-induced urinary calculi most often complicate high-dose, long-duration drug treatments, there also exist specific patient risk factors in relation to urine pH, urine output and other parameters, which provide a basis for preventive or curative treatment of calculi. Better awareness of the possible occurrence of lithogenic complications, preventive measures based on drug solubility characteristics and close surveillance of patients on long-term treatment with drugs with lithogenic potential, especially those with a history of urolithiasis, should reduce the incidence of drug-induced nephrolithiasis. © 2008 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.; MEDLINE® is the source for the MeSH terms of this document.

AB  - Context: The past decade has brought many advances to the treatment of epilepsy, including many new pharmacological agents. Primary care physicians often care for patients with epilepsy and therefore should be familiar with the new options available. Objective: To review data regarding the efficacy and tolerability of antiepileptic drugs introduced in the past decade. Data Sources: A search of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials was performed to identify all published human and English-language randomized controlled trials evaluating the efficacy and tolerability of the antiepileptic drugs that have been approved for use in the United States since 1990. Additional reports evaluating pharmacokinetic properties were identified through a MEDLINE search as well as review of article bibliographies. Study Selection and Data Extraction: Search terms included felbamate, gabapentin, lamotrigine, topiramate, tiagabine, levetiracetam, oxcarbazepine, and zonisamide. Studies were selected if efficacy and tolerability were reported as major outcome measures. Included studies (n = 55) enrolled a minimum of 20 adult subjects and had a treatment period of at least 6 weeks. Data Synthesis: Eight new antiepileptic drugs have been approved for use in the United States in the past decade. Each new antiepileptic drug is well tolerated and demonstrates statistically significant reductions in seizure frequency over baseline. No randomized controlled trials have compared the new antiepileptic drugs with each other or against the traditional antiepileptic drugs. Although there is no evidence to suggest that the newer medications are more efficacious, several studies have demonstrated broader spectrum of activity, fewer drug interactions, and overall better tolerability of the new agents. Conclusions: New antiepileptic drugs offer many options in the treatment of epilepsy, each with unique mechanisms of action as well as adverse effect profiles. The new antiepileptic drugs are well tolerated with few adverse effects, minimal drug interactions, and a broad spectrum of activity. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Context: Primary hyperparathyroidism is the most common cause of hypercalcemia in unselected patients. The ectopic gland locatiions should be known for the appropriate surgical exploration and for avoiding subsequent re-exploration that would represented higher mobidity. Multiple ectopic glands are rare and present a particular challege in parathyroid surgery. Case Report: A 65 year-old female presented with nephrolithiasis. Her serum total calcium was found to be elevated. The diagnosis of primary hyperparathyroidism was confirmed by the elevated serum intact parathyroid hormone levels. Ultrasound was only successful in localizing one adenoma in the lower right gland. Technetium sestamibi scanning correctly localized the same odenoma and showed another contralateral image, lateral to the thyroid cartilage. Fiber optic laryngoscopy showed on extrinsic mass pushing against the lateral and posterior walls of the left pyriform sinus. Resonance imaging revealed a soft tissue mass. Results: The patients underwent bilateral neck exploration. Histopathological examination confirmed the diagnosis of parathyroid double adenomas. The late-stage postoperative checkups were normal. Discussion: Routine bilateral neck surgery should be performed as a rule. We use ultrsound and technetium sestamibi scanning as a routine for preoperative localization studies. It is helpful to have an experienced surgeon for the localization. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The management of the fecal incontinence in children is difficult, and its social consequences are usually devastating. The general objectives of any bowel program are to produce social continence, predictability, and eventually independence. How to achieve those goals depends in part on the underlying condition. In children, fecal incontinence can occur from a variety of conditions. The most common is overflow incontinence from functional fecal retention, but it can also occur in otherwise healthy children with functional nonretentive fecal soiling or in children with organic causes of fecal incontinence, such as congenital malformations, or any other condition affecting the anorectum, anal sphincters, or the spinal cord. The therapeutic regimen that is recommended in patients with nonretentive fecal soiling consists of explanation and support for the child and parents, a nonaccusatory approach, and a toilet training program with a rewarding system. Biofeedback does not play an important role, and laxatives need to be used with caution, as they may exacerbate the incontinence. For those patients with congenital/neuropathic incontinence a combination of maneuvers to change stool consistency, colonic transit, anorectal function, and rectosigmoid evacuation is used. Stool consistency can be changed with the use of dietary interventions or medications. Stool transit can be slowed (antimotility agents) or accelerated (laxatives) with the use of medications. Anorectal function can be improved with the use of biofeedback or procedures to after sphincter pressure, and the production of a bowel movement can be induced with maneuvers to empty the sigmoid (suppositories, enemas). With the recent advent of the Antegrade Colonic Enema (ACE), the patient is then able to be predictable and independent. This procedure creates a continent conduit from the skin to the cecum that can be catheterized or accessed for self-administration of enemas. The ACE has revolutionized the treatment of children with fecal incontinence. Copyright © 2004 by Current Science Inc. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Unprovoked seizures are common, affecting approximately 4% of the population by age 80. Only approximately 30% to 40% of patients with a first seizure will have a second unprovoked seizure (ie, epilepsy). Treatment with antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) should not be initiated unless the diagnosis of a seizure is firm. Decisions regarding treatment of single unprovoked seizure must balance seizure recurrence risk, the potential impact of a recurrent seizure, the likelihood of adverse effects of treatment, and patient preference. Risk factors for seizure recurrence include a history of remote neurologic insult, epileptiform abnormalities on electroencephalogram, focal structural lesion on neuroimaging, and family history of epilepsy. Adult patients with these risk factors have a recurrence risk of 60% to 70% and usually should be treated with an AED to prevent seizure recurrence. Without risk factors, the recurrence risk is 20% to 30% and treatment depends on individual risk-to-benefit ratios and patient preference. Treatment of a first unprovoked seizure if often not necessary in childhood, especially if the seizure is part of a benign self-limited syndrome, such as benign Rolandic epilepsy of childhood. Treatment with an AED reduces the risk of seizure recurrence after a single unprovoked seizure. This must be balanced against the risk of adverse effects of AEDs. Treatment of the first seizure does not appear to affect the long-term prognosis of epilepsy. The choice of an AED should be guided by the seizure type and likely epilepsy syndrome diagnosis. Monotheraphy is preferable. Standard AED options include phenytoin, carbamazepine, valproate, ad phenobarbital. The newer AED, including gabapentin, lamotrigine, topiramate, oxcarbozepine, levetiracetam, and zonisamide, have good efficacy, favorable pharmacokinetic profiles, and often fewer adverse effects, supporting their use early in treatment. Not all of the newer AEDs are approved for use as monotheraphy. Patients with single seizures should be counseled about seizure first aid and general safety measures, including precautions regarding swimming alone, engaging in high-risk activities, driving, possible seizure precipitation by photic stimuli (in generalized epilepsy), sleep deprivation, and alcohol.

AB  - Background. Variation in the timing of calcium supplement may affect gastrointestinal absorption of both calcium and oxalate differently and may associate with variable risk of calcium oxalate nephrolithiasis. There are few human studies addressing specifically the appropriate time for taking calcium supplement. Therefore, this study was performed to compare calcium bioavailability and the risk of calcium oxalate stone formation for calcium supplement taken with meal vs. taken at bedtime. Methods. Thirty-two healthy male navy privates, 22.7 ± 1.9 years old (mean ± SD), who had normal renal function (serum creatinine less than 150 umol/L) and no history of renal stone, participated in the study. The subjects were randomly allocated into two groups of 16 each. Group A took 1 g of calcium carbonate with meal, 3 times/day; and group B took 3-g/day of calcium carbonate at bedtime. After taking the regimens for 1 week, followed by 1 month of washout period, crossover between both groups was done. The diet was controlled throughout the study. Twenty-four-hour urine collections for the determination of urinary constituents were obtained at baseline and after taking both regimens of calcium supplement. Activity product for calcium oxalate was determined to assess the risk of calcium oxalate stone formation. Results. Urinary excretions of calcium were significantly elevated above the baseline values when taking calcium supplement both with meal (3.48 ± 2.13 mmol/day vs. 5.17 ± 2.61 mmol/day, P < 0.05) and at bedtime (3.09 ± 1.70 mmol/day vs. 5.08 ± 2.34 mmol/day, P < 0.05). There was no difference between the two regimens in the urinary calcium excretions. The urinary oxalate was decreased significantly when the subjects took calcium supplement with meal compared with the corresponding baseline value (0.13 ± 0.05 vs. 0.17 ± 0.07 mmol/d, P = 0.01). In contrast, there was no alteration in urinary oxalate when calcium supplement was taken at bedtime compared to the baseline values (0.15 ± 0.05 mmol/day vs. 0.15 ± 0.06 mmol/day, P = 0.9). Compared with the corresponding baseline values, there was no significant increase in the activity product for calcium oxalate when taking calcium with meal (0.54 ± 0.25 vs. 0.57 ± 0.22, P = 0.54), but it was increased significantly when calcium supplement was taken at bedtime (0.47 ± 0.21 vs. 0.72 ± 0.27, P < 0.01). Conclusion. Calcium supplement should be taken with meal in order to avoid increasing the risk of calcium oxalate nephrolithiasis. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Pancreatolithiasis has been documented to occur naturally in humans and cattle. It has been associated with chronic pancreatitis in humans, and, when found, it may signify the presence of chronic pancreatic disease. This is the first report of a case involving a cat that had both an apparent obstruction with pancreatolithiasis as well as concurrent evidence of chronic pancreatic changes on histopathological evaluation. Additionally, this case documents the presence of a suspected congenital abnormality of a feline exocrine pancreas. © 2004 American Animal Hospital Association. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Osteoporosis is one of the leading health problems of women today, and the expectation is that more than 41 million women worldwide will be affected within the next 20 years if current trends are not reversed. Prevention of osteoporosis must be a focus for nurses, rather than merely the treatment of the problem. The majority of bone mass is developed during the adolescent and young adulthood years, with nearly 90% of skeletal mass accumulated by age 18. Current research has demonstrated that young women's intake of calcium is significantly below the recommended dietary intake. This article reviews the role and functions of calcium, how it is transported, and factors that may significantly increase or impair the absorption of this macronutrient. Strategies are described that will assist nurses in assessing the patient's diet and making appropriate recommendations regarding the intake of calcium and other micronutrients. A more in-depth and thorough understanding of this important mineral will enable nurses to strengthen their knowledge and confidence in helping patients and themselves change the focus from treating the disease to the improvement and maintenance of healthy bones and the prevention of other health conditions in women. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Urinary stone disease is frequent, and characterized by a high recurrence rate. Prevention of recurrent urolithiasis is possible using an appropriate diet with or without medications. Patients should be encouraged to have a high fluid intake. For an adult, urine volume should exceed 2000 ml/day. Diet modification should be done according to the various metabolic factors contributing to the formation of the stone (ie, hypercalciuria, hyperoxaluria, hypocitraturia, hyperuricuria, and so forth). Calcium intake should be around 1000 mg/day, protein intake limited to 1.2 g/kg/day, and salt intake kept to less than 100-150 mEq/jour. For uric acid urolithiasis, patient should limit uric acid intake to less than 500 mg/day. If these dietary manoeuvers fail, one can use thiazide diuretics to treat hypercalciuria, potassium citrate to correct hypocitraturia or sodium bicarbonate to alkalanize urine and prevent uric acid stone formation.

AB  - As adults with cystic fibrosis (CF) have enjoyed incremental increases in longevity over the last few decades, they have also been suffering from low bone density and its clinical manifestations, fractures and kyphosis. We conducted a placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blinded trial of alendronate (10 mg/day orally) (n = 24) compared with placebo (n = 24) for 1 year in 48 patients to improve bone mineral density at the spine as the primary endpoint. All patients received 800 IU of cholecalciferol and 1,000 mg of calcium carbonate. Both groups were similar in age, sex, CF mutations, bone density T scores, renal function, and body mass index at study onset. The alendronate-treated patients gained (mean ± SD) 4.9 ± 3.0% and 2. 8 ± 3.2% bone density after 1 year versus placebo, which lost (mean ± SD) 1.8 ± 4.0% and 0.7 ± 4.7%, in spine and femur bone density, respectively (p ≤ 0.001 for the spine; p = 0.003 for the femur). Urine N-telopeptide, a bone resorption marker, levels declined in the treatment group more than in the control group (p = 0.002), consistent with the known antiresorptive effects of bisphosphonates. Alendronate was more effective than placebo in improving spine and femur bone mineral density and is a promising agent for the long-term prevention and management of bone disease in patients with CF. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Whole animal studies using seawater European flounder (Platichthys flesus) revealed that increasing intestinal [Ca2+] to 20 mM stimulated net HCO<inf>3</inf>- base secretion by 57%, but this was effectively balanced by an increase in net acid secretion, likely from the gills, to maintain whole animal acid-base status. Higher Ca2+ concentrations (40 and 70 mM) in ambient seawater resulted in reduced plasma total CO <inf>2</inf>. This indicates (1) imperfect acid-base compensation, and (2) that endogenous metabolic CO<inf>2</inf> is insufficient to fuel intestinal HCO <inf>3</inf>- secretion, under hyper-stimulated conditions. Bicarbonate secretion plays an important role in preventing calcium absorption by precipitating a large fraction of the imbibed calcium as CaCO<inf>3</inf>. Indeed, under high Ca2+ conditions (20 mM), up to 75% of the intestinal Ca2+ is precipitated as CaCO<inf>3</inf> and then excreted. This is undoubtedly important in protecting the marine teleost kidney from the need for excessive calcium excretion and risk of renal stone formation. Using an in vitro pH-stat technique with the isolated intestinal epithelium, the replacement of serosal CO<inf>2</inf> with a HEPES buffered saline had no effect on HCO<inf>3</inf>- secretion, indicating that the endogenous supply of HCO<inf>3</inf>- from CO<inf>2</inf> hydration within epithelial cells is adequate for driving baseline secretion rates. Further, in vitro data demonstrated a stimulatory effect of low pH on intestinal HCO <inf>3</inf>- secretion. Thus, both luminal Ca2+ and H+ can regulate HCO<inf>3</inf>- secretion but the precise mechanisms and their potential interaction are currently unresolved. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Objective: To study the capacity of renal acidification in a group of children diagnosed of idiopathic hypercalciuria. Patient and Methods: 36 children were studied, to those that were determined the pCO<inf>2</inf> (UpCO<inf>2</inf>) maximum urinary with two different stimuli, acetazolamide and sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO<inf>3</inf>). At 33 of them, was performed an acidification test with frusemide stimulus. We studied a control group of 13 healthy children so much for the first one as the second tests and other 14 healthy children for the acidification test with frusemide. Results: In the tests performed with NaHCO<inf>3</inf> and acetazolamide stimulus, they were not proven differences in the values of UpCO<inf>2</inf> neither in the urinary concentration of HCO<inf>3</inf>- (UHCO<inf>3</inf>-) than control children. Nevertheless, the UpCO<inf>2</inf> and the concentration of UHCO<inf>3</inf>- in the patients were significantly lower with acetazolamide with regard to the NaHCO<inf>3</inf> stimulus. In the acidification test with frusemide, significantly lower values of titratable acid and ammonium were obtained than control children. Conclusions: In children with idiopathic hypercalciuria, the capacity of secretion of H+ is normal, what is evidenced, especially, when studying the maximum UpCO <inf>2</inf> after stimulus with NaHCO<inf>3</inf>. When diuretics are used as stimuli, exists more negative results that can be due to a certain partial resistance to the action of the same ones or to that are less potent to induce the secretion of H+. © 2008 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - This review provides an overview of traditional as well as emerging therapies useful in the management of pediatric short bowel syndrome. Pediatric short bowel syndrome is relatively uncommon; however, when it does occur, it presents a unique challenge to medical care providers. The use of parenteral and enteral nutrition to maximize growth and enhance intestinal adaptation so as to increase absorptive surface area has been the primary focus of therapy. In recent years, the advent of pharmacologic advances, including the use of antibacterial drugs, anti-motility drugs and hormonal therapies, has had a significant impact on this condition. At times, surgery may be indicated for dealing with complications, or providing alternative therapy such as transplantation. With ongoing research, it is likely that improved pharmacologic therapy will be available for enhanced intestinal adaptation, control of gut motility, treatment of small bowel bacterial overgrowth, and treatment of rejection following small intestinal transplantation. © 2008 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.; MEDLINE® is the source for the MeSH terms of this document.

AB  - Osteoporosis is a significant problem in women and men. In addition, as osteoporosis has garnered more attention there should be more attention than ever placed on the potential benefits of calcium and vitamin D. Clinicians need to inform patients that there are numerous healthy dietary sources of calcium and vitamin D. Calcium and vitamin D supplements seem to act synergistically to reduce fracture risk in men and women; therefore, they need to be taken together to impact fracture risk. In addition, almost every randomized trial of an effective osteoporosis drug therapy has utilized calcium and vitamin D to enhance the efficacy of the drug itself. Several forms of calcium supplements are commercially available today and clinicians need to understand the similarities and differences between them. Calcium and vitamin D in moderation also have a good safety profile and may actually have benefits far beyond osteoporosis therapy. For example, calcium may increase high-density lipoprotein (HDL), prevent colon polyps, reduce blood pressure, reduce kidney stone recurrence, and may promote weight loss. Vitamin D may reduce the risk of some cancers, provide an enhanced response to some chemotherapeutic agents, prevent type I diabetes, and may reduce tooth loss along with calcium. Clinicians need to encourage individuals to receive the recommended daily allowance of these two agents because they seem to have an impact on numerous health conditions besides osteoporosis. © 2003 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Inpatients with spinal cord injury (SCI), significant bone loss with subsequent osteoporosis is associated with severe complications, such as pathologic fractures, nephrolithiasis, and heterotopic ossification. The recognition of the potential for bone loss and the prevention of osteoporosis have become important in the care of patients with SCI. In this review article, the main focus is on bone loss in acute SCI. Bone-related metabolic changes and osteoporosis after acute SCI are summarized, mechanism(s) for development of the osteoporosis are explored, and the current concepts for prevention and treatment of osteoporosis in acute SCI are provided. © 2008 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - A 70-year-old man was referred to our hospital because of pollakisuria and urinary stream stoppage due to a giant stone in the neobladder. Seven years earlier, he had undergone total cystoprostatectomy and bladder replacement using the sigmoid colon because of a bladder tumor. KUB on routine follow-up showed a stone in the pelvic region and left lower ureter, which had a maximal diameter of approximately 8.5 cm. DIP revealed a normal right upper urinary tract, but the left upper urinary tract was not visible due to the ureteral stone. Pelvic CT scan also showed a mega stone in the neobladder. Physical examination at the time of presentation was normal, and blood chemistry was almost within the normal range. Urine bacterial culture detected both Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Providencia rettgeri, and subsequently the patient was hospitalized and transabdominal lithotomy was performed. The stone was identified easily and extracted completely. The removed stone weighed 360 g, and measured 8.8×7.9×7.2 cm. Stone analysis revealed MAP, CaCO3 and CaPO4. The postoperative course was uneventful. The patient's symptoms improved and he remains free from recurrent stones six months after the operation. The condition of the left ureteral stone continues to be monitored at our hospital. © 2008 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Objective. To study the activity of vitamin K-dependent γ-glutamyl carboxylase in patients with calcium oxalate (CaOx) urolithiasis compared with healthy individuals and to assess its relationship to the renal calcium oxalate urolithiasis. Methods. Renal parenchymas were harvested from urolithic patients and renal tumor patients undergoing nephrectomy. The renal carboxylase activity was evaluated as the radioactivity of [14C] labeled sodium bicarbonate in carboxylic reactions in vitro using β-liquid scintillation counting. Results. Significantly reduced activity of renal vitamin K-dependent γ-glutamyl carboxylase was observed in the urolithic group as compared with normal controls (P<0.01). Conclusion. It suggests that the reduced carboxylase activity observed in the urolithic patients may play an important role in the course of renal calcium oxalate urolithiasis. © 2008 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.; MEDLINE® is the source for the MeSH terms of this document.

AB  - We describe a model to illustrate different chemical interactions that can occur in urine following ingestion of individual and combined health supplements. Two types of interactions are defined: synergism and addition. The model was applied to eight healthy males who participated in a study to investigate the chemical interactions between calcium carbonate, magnesium oxide and sodium citrate-bicarbonate health supplements on calcium oxalate urinary stone risk factors. Subjects ingested these components individually and in combination for 7 days. Twenty-four-hour urines were collected at baseline and during the final day of supplementation. These were analysed using standard laboratory techniques. Three different chemical interactions, all involving citrate, were identified: magnesium and citrate exerted a synergistic effect on lowering the relative superaturation (RS) of brushite; the same two components produced a synergistic effect on raising pH; finally, calcium and citrate exerted an additive effect on lowering the RS of uric acid. We propose that the novel approach described in this paper allows for the evaluation of individual, additive and synergistic interactions in the assessment of the efficacy of stone-risk reducing preparations. © 2008 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.; MEDLINE® is the source for the MeSH terms of this document.

AB  - Numerous medical, surgical, psychiatric, gynecologic, and obstetric disorders can cause abdominal pain during pregnancy. The patient history, physical examination, laboratory data, and radiologic findings usually provide the diagnosis. The pregnant woman has physiologic alterations that affect the clinical presentation, including atypical normative laboratory values. Abdominal ultrasound is generally the recommended radiologic imaging modality; roentgenograms are generally contraindicated during pregnancy because of radiation teratogenicity. Concerns about the fetus limit the pharmacotherapy. Maternal and fetal survival have recently increased in many life-threatening conditions, such as ectopic pregnancy, appendicitis, and eclampsia, because of improved diagnostic technology, better maternal and fetal monitoring, improved laparoscopic technology, and earlier therapy. © 2008 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.; MEDLINE® is the source for the MeSH terms of this document.

AB  - Abnormal liver function tests in patients with intestinal failure (IF) may be due to the underlying disease, IF or the treatments given (including parenteral nutrition (PN)). PN-related liver disease in children usually relates to intrahepatic cholestasis and in adults to steatosis. Steatosis may be consequent upon an excess of carbohydrate, lipid or protein, or upon a deficiency of a specific molecule. Pigment-type gallstones are common in adults and children with IF; these develop from biliary sludge that forms during periods of gallbladder stasis. Ileal disease/resection, parenteral nutrition, surgery, rapid weight loss and drugs all increase the risk of developing gallstones. Gallstone formation may be prevented by reducing gallbladder stasis (oral/enteral feeding or prokinetic agents), altering bile composition, or by means of a prophylactic cholecystectomy. Calcium oxalate renal stones are common in patients with a short bowel and retained functioning colon and are consequent upon increased absorption of dietary oxalate; they are prevented by a low-oxalate diet. An osteopathy may occur with long-term parenteral nutrition. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Effective antiretroviral therapy [ART] has improved the mortality and morbidity due to HIV infection in the developed nations. Potent regimens require a combination of three or more drugs to suppress the viral replication to very low levels. Before commencing therapy, various issues such as guidelines for initiation of treatment, monitoring, toxicity, resistance, compliance and adherence to treatment need to be adequately addressed. Cost and access to health care are other limiting factors. Due to these complexities, the ART should be initiated by physicians with expertise in the use of these agents. Long term benefit and safety must be considered. This review aims to provide the primary care physicians with practical information on antiretroviral drugs that are available for treatment. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - An adequate calcium intake is an essential part of the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis. Two to three serves of calcium-rich foods each day provides sufficient calcium for most non-pregnant adults. If this target is not achievable, calcium supplementation is generally effective, cheap and safe for most people. Calcium carbonate (without vitamin and mineral additives) is the preferred supplement in most cases. Problems with calcium absorption arise due to factors including high-fibre vegetarian diets, achlorhydria, long-term glucocorticoid therapy and vitamin D deficiency. Vitamin D deficiency is extremely common in some ethnic groups and the elderly who are housebound or in residential care. These at-risk groups generally require vitamin D supplementation to achieve adequate intestinal absorption of calcium. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Urinary citric acid and calcium levels have been estimated in the urine of 20 normal healthy persons as well as 12 urinary stone patients. Inhibition efficiency of these urine samples towards the mineralisation of urinary stone forming minerals, viz., calcium phosphate, oxalate or carbonate, has been studied in an experimental model. Statistical correlation of the above data has been made by computing the coefficient of determination and unexplained variance. Clinico-biochemical indexing of calcium urolithiasis risk factor has been attempted in the light of the data. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Cell life is possible only if intracellular pH (pHi) oscillations are kept within a very narrow range. Measurement of pHi is therefore a very important parameter when examining cell and organ functions. Several methods have been used to monitor pHi; these include fluorescent dyes and pH sensitive electrodes. In addition, many instruments have been applied to the detection of pHi in living organs even at the level of single cells: NMR and confocal microscopy are just an example. Transport proteins located on the cell membrane and intracellular vesicles are responsible for maintaining the correct pHi. In renal tubular cells these include the sodium hydrogen exchanger (NHE), the sodium-dependent and independent chloride-bicarbonate exchanger (Cl--HCO3-), the sodium bicarbonate co-transport (Na+-HCO3-), the ATP-coupled proton pump (H+-ATPasi) and the ATP-dependent proton-potassium pump (H+-K+-ATPasi). All these carriers have been cloned and it is now clear that there are several isoforms with specific properties. The function of these proteins is closely linked to several hormone blood levels, systemic acid-base status, protein diet content as well as other factors. In addition, these carriers are not homogeneously distributed along the nephron and are sensitive to specific stimuli like interstitial osmolality and luminal fluid flow rate. Finally, it has been recently demonstrated that the pHi may be involved in numerous aspects of cell function, such as metabolism, apoptosis, malignancy and it is implicated in the pathogenesis of particular forms of renal stones (Dent's disease).

AB  - Background: Increased vitamin D intake may preserve or increase bone mineral density (BMD) in older persons. Objective: A 2-y double-blind study was undertaken to determine whether weekly administration of 10 000 units of vitamin D<inf>2</inf> maintained or increased BMD in younger postmenopausal women more efficiently than did calcium supplements alone. Design: One hundred eighty-seven women who were ≥ 1 y postmenopausal were randomly assigned to take either 1000 mg Ca/d after the evening meal or 1000 mg Ca/d plus 10 000 U vitamin D <inf>2</inf>/wk in a double-blind, placebo-controlled format. The BMD of the proximal forearm, lumbar spine, femoral neck, Ward's triangle, and femoral trochanter was measured at 6-mo intervals by osteodensitometry. Results: During the 2-y period, there was no significant difference in the change in BMD at any site between the subjects taking calcium supplements and those taking calcium plus vitamin D2. Both groups significantly (P < 0.005) gained BMD in Ward's triangle and the femoral trochanter but significantly (P < 0.005) lost bone in the proximal radius. There was no significant change in the lumbar spine or femoral neck BMD. Conclusion: In younger postmenopausal women (x- age: 56 y) whose average baseline serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration was well within the normal range, the addition of 10 000 U vitamin D<inf>2</inf>/wk to calcium supplementation at 1000 mg/d did not confer benefits on BMD beyond those achieved with calcium supplementation alone. © 2003 American Society for Clinical Nutrition. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Purpose: To evaluate the efficacy of levetiracetam in cases of refractory primary generalised epilepsy. Methods: Three patients with refractory primary generalised epilepsy were treated with levetiracetam monotherapy; one with absence seizures, myoclonic jerks and generalised tonic-clonic (GTC) seizures one with myoclonic jerks and GTC seizures, and one with only GTC seizures. All three patients had generalised spike wave on the EEG and had failed at least three antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) before trying levetiracetam. Results: All three patients tolerated levetiracetam well and became seizure free for at least 6 months. Therapeutic doses of levetiracetam ranged from 1250 to 3000 mg/day. Conclusion: Levetiracetam, a new AED with a novel mechanism(s) of action, should be considered for patients with refractory primary generalised epilepsy. © 2002 BEA Trading Ltd.

AB  - In this article a detailed revision of the therapeutic applications of the calcium salts of most frequent use, is made. The metabolism, the bioavailability and the clinical use of the different calcium formulations vary significantly according to the salt used. The physiologic order factors, the physicochemical, the technological and the formulation ones influence in the bioavailability and, they alter the therapeutic answer. The salts of most frequent use, carbonate, citrate, pidolate, dobesilate, gluconate, phosphate and lactate, contribute in different quantities of elementary calcium. Recent studies show significant data that can be of importance in the clinical practice. The most habitual uses in the calcium salts are: for the osteoporosis treatment and prevention; in osteopenia; in hypocalcemia states; for low contribution or bad absorption; as dietary supplement, according to the recommended daily ingesta and also, in vascular illnesses, like in internal hemorrhoids, phlebopathy and in diabetic retinopathy. It is concluded that it is fundamental to contribute the appropriate quantity of calcium according to the individual requirements and, on that base, to select the appropriate formula keeping in mind the variability that takes place in the absorption in connection with the salt used. © 2008 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.; MEDLINE® is the source for the MeSH terms of this document.

AB  - Objective: The incidence of renal stones in patients on dialysis, while lower in number compared to the general population because of decreased renal function, is nonetheless a clinical dilemma. We wanted to evaluate the incidence and management of stone disease in patients on hemodialysis. Methods: We reviewed the literature from 1966 to the present using Medline. Study inclusion criteria were detection and treatment of stone disease in both hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis patients. Results: It is estimated that between 5 and 13% of all dialysis patients will develop symptomatic renal calculi and many more asymptomatic calculi. Many of the stone-forming dialysis patients will have recurring stone disease with one study finding an 83.3% recurrence rate. Conclusions: Since dialysis patients have a wide range of urine output, the clinician should be alert to the possibility of stone formation. We recommend yearly ultrasound examinations on all dialysis patients as well as citrate and magnesium supplements with careful follow-up of laboratory results and urine electrolytes. We also recommend careful follow-up of all patients on aluminum-hydroxide phosphate binders as they are predisposed to form Al-Mg-urate stones. For those dialysis patients that form renal calculi, watchful waiting and symptomatic treatment is recommended since almost all patients will spontaneously pass their stones. However, ESWL and other current modalities may be used with no greater morbidity compared to nondialysis cohorts. We also suggest that patients with severe recurring intractable stone disease who are candidates for renal transplantation should be offered bilateral nephrectomies. Copyright © 2002 S.

AB  - The medical treatment of nephrolithiasis is aimed in particular at the prevention of relapses, even though in some cases, such as cystine or uric acid lithiasis, the calculi also can be dissolved on site. When the diagnosis and metabolic profile have been performed correctly, medical treatment is effective in a large number of patients. The greatest difficulty is the patient's compliance with the most suitable prevention measures and the frequency of follow-up controls. This compliance can be influenced significantly by the amount of time that the doctor spends to explain the origin of the disease. This article reviews the main methods available for the medical treatment of various nephrolithiasis types, namely water intake, diet, and drugs, supplying the relevant information about the mechanism of action, metabolic consequences, indications, evidence provided from studies, dosage, efficacy, and side-effects. Finally, brief simplified guidelines are given for the medical treatment of stone disease caused by calcium oxalate or calcium phosphate, uric acid, cystine, and struvite. © 2005 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Objective: To present the long-term results of ileum interposition in the ureter for uni- or bilateral ureteral obstruction. Patients and Methods: Between 1981 and 2000, a total of 22 patients received an ileal segment interposition as a substitution for the ureter, of whom 18 were available for analysis. The mean age was 54 years (range 29-73). Patients were followed for a mean period of 65 months (range 2-196). Assessment included clinical examination, serum creatinine levels, renal ultrasonography, intravenous pyelography and isotopic renography. In eight patients, the ileal-ureteral substitution was the first reconstructive procedure. The other patients underwent up to four previous reconstructions of different types. Fourteen patients were treated for unilateral ureteral obstruction, four of whom had a functional or anatomical solitary kidney, the other four patients had bilateral obstruction. Results: In 16 patients renal function improved after ileal-ureteral substitution. One patient underwent a nephrectomy because of a decreased renal function due to an obstruction at the level of the uretero-ileal anastomosis. One patient had a nephrectomy because of recurrent macroscopic hematuria caused by multiple arterio-venous malformations. Overall, 15 patients (83%) had a good functioning kidney after a mean period of 65 months. In three patients an early reintervention was necessary because of bleeding, small bowel obstruction and urinary leakage from a pyelo-ileal anastomosis. Six patients required a reintervention in the long-term: two had a nephrectomy, three had a re-anastomosis between the renal pelvis and the proximal ileal segment, while the sixth patient underwent a PNL for a kidney stone. Recurrent urinary tract infections were seen in six patients, of whom three had to undergo a reintervention. Metabolic acidosis was detected in two patients and was treated with sodium bicarbonate substitution. Conclusion: Ileal-ureteral substitution is a valuable procedure with good long-term results and an acceptable rate of secondary interventions in patients for whom other alternatives are not feasible. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - Purpose of review: Patients who undergo urinary tract diversion are at an increased risk of urolithiasis for various reasons. The purpose of this article is to provide an up-to-date summary of the progress that has been made in the pathogenesis, diagnosis and treatment of stones in patients with urinary diversions. Finally, we will provide recommendations for follow-up in patients with urinary diversions who develop urinary tract calculi. Recent findings: In contemporary studies, the incidence of urolithiasis in patients with urinary diversion appears to be decreasing. Computed tomography scanning has been shown to be superior to ultrasound in the diagnosis of calculi in such patients. Endourological procedures have become the mainstay of therapy for stones in patients with urinary diversions. Since the introduction of extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy, percutaneous nephrolithotripsy and ureteroscopy, the need for open surgery has decreased, even in this anatomically unique and surgically challenging patient population. Summary: Urolithiasis is an established long-term complication of urinary diversion. In recent years, significant advances have been made in the pathogenesis, diagnosis and treatment of such stones. As a result of potential stone-related complications, we recommend lifelong surveillance for all patients with urinary stones and diversions, with medical therapy when indicated, in order to minimize these complications. © 2002 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins. © 2008 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.; MEDLINE® is the source for the MeSH terms of this document.

AB  - Genetic disorders of acid-base transporters involve plasmalemmal and organellar transporters of H+, HCO<inf>3</inf>-, and Cl-. Autosomal-dominant and -recessive forms of distal renal tubular acidosis (dRTA) are caused by mutations in ion transporters of the acid-secreting Type A intercalated cell of the renal collecting duct. These include the AE1 Cl-/HCO<inf>3</inf>- exchanger of the basolateral membrane and at least two subunits of the apical membrane vacuolar (v)H+-ATPase, the V<inf>1</inf> subunit B1 (associated with deafness) and the V<inf>0</inf> subunit a4. Recessive proximal RTA with ocular disease arises from mutations in the electrogenic Na+-bicarbonate cotransporter NBC1 of the proximal tubular cell basolateral membrane. Recessive mixed proximal-distal RTA accompanied by osteopetrosis and mental retardation is associated with mutations in cytoplasmic carbonic anhydrase II. The metabolic alkalosis of congenital chloride-losing diarrhea is caused by mutations in the DRA Cl-/HCO<inf>3</inf>- exchanger of the ileocolonic apical membrane. Recessive osteopetrosis is caused by deficient osteoclast acid secretion across the raffled border lacunar membrane, the result of mutations in the vH+-ATPase V<inf>0</inf> subunit or in the CLC-7 Cl- channel. X-linked nephrolithiasis and engineered deficiencies in some other CLC Cl- channels are thought to represent defects of organellar acidification. Study of acid-base transport disease-associated mutations should enhance our understanding of protein structure-function relationships and their impact on the physiology of cell, tissue, and organism. © 2008 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.; MEDLINE® is the source for the MeSH terms of this document.

AB  - In this retrospective study, 31 Kuwaiti children with renal stones were reviewed between January 1996 and September 2000. Male to Female ratio was 2.1:1 with a mean age at presentation of 38 months. Family history of renal stones was reported in 58%. Stones were localized to the kidneys in 74.1%, to ureters in 6% and to the bladder in 9.6%. Bilateral stones were found in 64.5%. Clinical manifestations included: hematuria in 70.9%, passage of stones in 64.5%, abdominal pain in 41.9%, urinary tract infections in 29%, sterile pyuria in 22.9% and urine retention in 16%. Causes of stone formation included hypercalciuria in 38.7%, hyperoxaluria in 19.3%, cystinuria in 12.9%, xanthinuria in 12.9%, urinary tract infection in 3.2%, obstruction in 9.6% and idiopathic in 32.2%. In conclusion, lithogenic metabolic causes were found to be the major predisposing factors to stone formation among Kuwaiti children whereas diet and environmental factors played a trivial role. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Recent studies showed that postmenopausal women lost less bone mass when supplemented with calcium or estrogen therapy. However, the safety of the treatments in terms of the risk of calcium oxalate stone formation is unknown. We therefore conducted this study to determine the alteration in calcium oxalate supersaturation after calcium supplement or after combined calcium and estrogen therapy in postmenopausal osteoporotic women. Methods: Fifty-six postmenopausal women were enrolled in this study. All subjects were more than 10 years postmenopausal with vertebral or femoral osteoporosis by bone mineral density criteria. They were randomly allocated to receive either 625 mg of calcium carbonate (250 mg of elemental calcium) at the end of a meal three times a day (group A, n = 26) or calcium carbonate in the same manner plus 0.625 mg/day of conjugated equine estrogen and 5 mg medrogestone acetate from day 1-12 each month (group B, n = 30). The age (mean ± S.E.M.) was 66.3 ± 1.2 and 65.1 ± 1.1 years, weight 54.1 ± 1.2 and 55.3 ± 2.1 kg, in group A and group B, respectively. Urine specimens (24-h) were collected at baseline and 3 months after treatment for the determination of calcium oxalate saturation by using Tiselius's index (AP(CaOx)) and calcium/citrate ratio. Results: After 3 months of treatment, there was no significant alteration from baseline for urinary excretion of calcium, citrate and oxalate. Urinary phosphate excretion was significantly reduced (6.3 ± 0.7 vs. 5.1 ± 0.7 mmol/day for group A and 8.2 ± 0.9 vs. 5.8 ± 0.7 mmol/day for group B, P < 0.05), whereas net alkaline absorption was significantly elevated (10.1 ± 3.6 vs. 20.1 ± 4.4 meq/day for group A and 4.8 ± 3.2 vs. 19.9 ± 3.6 meq/day for group B, P < 0.05). Calcium/citrate ratio and AP(CaOx) determined at baseline were not different from the corresponding values after treatment in both groups; calcium/citrate: 10.1 ± 3.1 vs. 10.1 ± 2.5 for group A and 9.3 ± 1.8 vs. 11.9 ± 2.5 for group B and AP(CaOx): 1.1 ± 0.1 vs. 1.3 ± 0.2 for group A and 1.2 ± 0.2 vs. 1.1 ± 0.1 for group B. There were eight and nine patients with high AP(CaOx), or > 2, at baseline and after treatment, respectively. Conclusions: Calcium supplement with a meal or combined calcium supplement and estrogen therapy is not associated with a significant increased risk of calcium oxalate stone formation in the majority of postmenopausal osteoporotic patients. Determination of urinary saturation for calcium oxalate after calcium and estrogen supplements, especially at the initial phase of treatment, may be helpful in the avoidance of nephrolithiasis. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

AB  - Purpose: Uric acid calculi with or without a calcium component comprise a significant proportion of urinary stones. Knowledge of the pathophysiology of stone formation is important to direct medical treatment. The aim of this review is to provide an update on the epidemiology, pathophysiology and management of uric acid renal stones. Materials and Methods: A MEDLINE search was performed on the topic of uric acid stones. Current literature was reviewed with regard to the epidemiology, pathophysiology, associated medical conditions and management of uric acid stones. Results: The incidence of uric acid stones varies between countries and accounts for 5% to 40% of all urinary calculi. Hyperuricuria, low urinary output and acidic urine are well known contributing factors. However, the most important factor for uric acid stone formation is persistently acidic urine. Gout and myeloproliferative disorders are associated with uric acid stones. Why most patients with gout present with acidic urine yet only 20% have uric acid stone formation remains unclear. The pathophysiological basis for persistent urine acidity also remains unclear although various mechanisms have been proposed. Urinary alkalization with potassium citrate or sodium bicarbonate is a highly effective treatment, resulting in dissolution of existing stones and prevention of recurrence. Conclusions: Acidic urine is a prerequisite for uric acid stone formation and growth. Medical management with urinary alkalization for stone dissolution and prevention of recurrence is effective and should be the cornerstone of treatment. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Objective - To describe a technique for endoscope-assisted disruption and removal of urinary calculi using a holmium:YAG laser in sedated, standing horses. Study Design - Retrospective study. Animals - Six horses with urinary calculi. Methods - A holmium:YAG laser was used to disrupt naturally occurring urinary calculi in horses (4 geldings, 1 stallion, 1 mare). Ischial urethrotomy was performed in male horses to provide a portal for the endoscope and laser fiber. Calculus fragments were removed by a combination of lavage, transendoscopic basket snare removal, forceps, and digital manipulation. Ischial urethrotomies healed by second intention. Follow-up was obtained by recheck examination and telephone interview of owners. Results - No major operative or postoperative complications occurred. Two calculi (1 stallion and 1 mare) were fragmented by a combination of laser ablation and manual disruption with a lithotrite. Postoperative dysuria occurred in the mare, but resolved after 1 month. Mean (± SD) follow-up was 306 ± 149 days; no other complications were reported. Conclusions - Calcium carbonate urinary calculi (up to 15 cm in diameter) in horses can be effectively fragmented with a holmium:YAG laser. It is not known if this technique would be completely effective for larger calculi or extremely dense calculi. Clinical Relevance - Calculus disruption by an endoscopically assisted holmium:YAG laser offers a minimally invasive method that can be performed in standing horses and that minimizes patient risk. © Copyright 2002 by The American College of Veterinary Surgeons. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Data on the efficacy and tolerability of antiretrovirals in children are limited as, in contrast to adult studies, large paediatric cohort studies are lacking. Thus, data pertaining to adults are often extrapolated to children despite the acknowledgement that children are not little adults. This review summarises information gathered from existing reports and focuses on the tolerabilities of antiretrovirals in children infected with HIV-1. The efficacy of antiretrovirals is not included in the scope of the discussion. Taste of antiretrovirals should be an important factor when considering the tolerability of antiretrovirals in children. However, antiretroviral options are often limited in young children as only some of the antiretrovirals are available as paediatric formulations. All antiretrovirals have been associated with toxicities in children, but in general, they are relatively well tolerated. The gastrointestinal system including hepatic system is most prone to being affected by these drugs. Skin rashes and hypersensitivity reactions are also associated with antiretroviral use, particularly with the non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Mitochondrial toxicities that lead to impairment of liver function, pancreatic function and lactic acidosis are associated with most of the nucleoside analogues. Haematological toxicity is often a dose limiting adverse effect especially of the nucleoside analogues, in particular zidovudine. The protease inhibitors are associated with gastrointestinal intolerance (diarrhoea) and metabolic derangements that can lead to hypercholesterolaemia and hypertriglyceridaemia, which in turn and can lead to changes in body habitus. The renal system is also affected by several drugs, the most important of which is indinavir, which has been associated with renal stones and damage to the renal tubules. Fortunately, with lower incidence of major toxicity and with the range of drugs now available for paediatric use, toxicities are usually not a barrier to effect antiretroviral therapy in children. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Rabbits possess a unique calcium metabolism. Most mammals regulate blood calcium to maintain levels within a narrow range by controlling the absorption of calcium from the diet according to need. Rabbits, however, have adopted the different strategy of absorbing nearly all of the dietary calcium ingested and excreting the excess by means of the kidneys. This results in a situation in which blood levels reflect the level of calcium in the diet, and calcium carbonate is excreted in large amounts in the urine. The current understanding of the interaction of parathyroid hormone, calcitonin, calcium, and vitamin D is described, and the clinical implications of rabbit calcium metabolism for conditions including urolithiasis and dental disease are discussed.

AB  - Objectives. To analyze the impact of water hardness from public water supplies on calcium stone incidence and 24-hour urine chemistries in patients with known calcium urinary stone formation. Patients are frequently concerned that their public water supply may contribute to urinary stone disease. Investigators have documented an inverse relationship between water hardness and calcium lithogenesis. Others have found no such association. Methods. Patients who form calcium stones (n = 4833) were identified geographically by their zip code. Water hardness information from distinct geographic public water supplies was obtained, and patient 24-hour urine chemistries were evaluated. Drinking water hardness was divided into decile rankings on the basis of the public water supply information obtained from the Environmental Protection Agency. These data were compared with patient questionnaires and 24-hour urine chemistries. The calcium and magnesium levels in the drinking water were analyzed as independent variables. Results. The number of total lifetime stone episodes was similar between patients residing in areas with soft public water and hard public water. Patients consuming the softest water decile formed 3.4 lifetime stones and those who consumed the hardest water developed 3.0 lifetime stones (P = 0.0017). The 24-hour urine calcium, magnesium, and citrate levels increased directly with drinking water hardness, and no significant change was found in urinary oxalate, uric acid, pH, or volume. Conclusions. The impact of water hardness on urinary stone formation remains unclear, despite a weak correlation between water hardness and urinary calcium, magnesium, and citrate excretion. Tap water, however, can change urinary electrolytes in patients who form calcium stones. © 2002, Elsevier Science Inc. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Analysis of 22 510 urinary calculi between January 1991 to July 2000 performed by infrared spectroscopy allows for separation of drug-induced urolithiasis into two categories: first, the drugs physically embedded in the stone (n=238; 1.0 per cent), notably indinavir monohydrate (n=126; 52.9 per cent), followed by triamterene (n=43; 18.1 per cent), sulphonamides (n=29; 12.2 per cent) and amorphous silica (n=24; 10.1 per cent); second, the category of metabolic nephrolithiasis induced by drugs (n=140; 0.6 per cent), involving mainly calcium and vitamin D supplementation (n=56; 40.0 per cent) and carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (n=33; 23.6 per cent). Composition of the stone depended not only on the inducer drug but also on the metabolic state of the patient. Today, drug-induced stones comprise about 1.6 per cent of all calculi in France. Physical analysis and therapeutic history recall of such patients are the keys to diagnosis. Medical care is based on drug avoidance or dose adjusmaent with increased diuresis and, if necessary, change in urinary pH. © 2008 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.; MEDLINE® is the source for the MeSH terms of this document.

AB  - Introduction: Milk of calcium is a rare condition of salts in suspension within a renal cyst. Its clinical characteristics may mimic urinary calculi, although its presentation is often as an unusual image in routine examinations. Treatment should be conservative or surgical, depending on its clinical manifestations. Case Report: A 47 year-old female was admitted with severe pain on right lumbar and right upper abdomen associated with vomiting, but without any urinary complaint. Physical examination revealed abdominal pain and right lumbar percussion pain. Plain x-ray showed a radiopaque area in the right kidney upper pole. Urinalysis was normal. The patient reported a similar episode five years ago, when ultrasonography revealed a layer of milk of calcium in the aforementioned region and she had been advised to remain on conservative treatment. After undergoing treatment with antispasmodic and nonhormonal antinflammatory drugs, the patient was discharged after 24 hours with partial relief of pain. However, with the persistence of moderate pain for approximately two months the decision was to surgical treatment. Preoperative ultrasonography and excretory urography showed calculus in a pyelogenic cyst. A partial right upper pole nephrectomy was performed and the postoperative histopathology demonstrated a renal cyst with intracavitary calcium carbonate. At 6 months of follow-up the patient reported complete relief of symptoms. © 2004 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam. All rights reserved.

AB  - Osteoporosis is a systemic progressive disease with important clinical complications because of the fractures that arise and cause morbidity in especially the aging postmenopausal women. It is recognized as an important public health problem because of the significant morbidity and mortality associated with its complication, namely fractures of the proximal femur (hip), vertebrae (spine), distal forearm, proximal humerus, pelvis, and other skeletal sites. Compared with other osteoporotic fractures, however, fractures of the hip incur the greatest morbidity and direct medical costs for health services. There are now a variety of treatments available for the management of osteoporosis. The inhibitors of bone resorption, which include calcium, the vitamin Ds, bisphosphonates, calcitonins and gonadal steroids have been variously shown to prevent bone loss or to reduce fractures. On the other hand bone formation stimulating agents as fluorides must be considered also. However, prevention of osteoporosis during the teen and early adult years is far superior to any of the treatment for older individuals with identification of risk factors, careful examination and a few simple diagnostic tests. The purpose of this review is to provide an general overview of an osteoporosis. © 2004 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam. All rights reserved.

AB  - Study design: A matched case-control study. Objectives: To clarify the influence of urine specific gravity and drinking water quality on the formation of urinary stones in persons with spinal cord injury (SCI). Setting: A rehabilitation center within a university hospital. Methods: Between 1992 and 1998, 63 stone cases (31 kidney, 27 bladder, and five both) and 289 age-duration-matched controls were recruited from a cohort of SCI patients enrolled in an on-going longitudinal study. Data on urine specific gravity and other characteristics of study participants were retrieved from the database and medical charts. Community water supply information was provided by the Alabama Department of Environmental Management. Multivariable conditional logistic regression analysis was performed to evaluate the association with stone formation. Results: SCI individuals who had urinary stones were more likely than control subjects to use indwelling catheters and have decreased renal function. The occurrence of stones was not significantly related to gender, race, severity of injury, urinary tract infection, nor urine pH. After controlling for the potential confounding from other factors, a continuously increasing stone occurrence with increasing specific gravity was observed (P= 0.05); this association was stronger for kidney (odds Ratio [OR] = 1.8 per 0.010 g/cm3) versus bladder stones (OR = 1.2) and for recurrent (OR = 2.0) versus first stones (OR = 1.5). Increased water hardness was not significantly associated with a decreased stone occurrence. Conclusions: Study results suggest that maintaining urine specific gravity below a certain level might reduce the occurrence of urinary stones. This could be easily achieved by using a dipstick for self-feedback along with appropriate fluid intake. For persons with SCI who are at an increased risk of a devastating stone disease, this prophylactic approach could be very cost-effective; however, this requires further confirmation. © 2007 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.; Medline is the source for the MeSH terms of this document.

AB  - Kidney stones are common in industrialised nations: up to 15% of white men and 6% of all women will develop one stone, with recurrence in about half these people. Risk factors for formation of stones include urinary promoters (calcium, urate, cystine, and sodium) and urinary inhibitors (magnesium, citrate, and nephrocalcin). Acute renal colic can be precipitated by dehydration and reduced urine output, increased protein intake, heavy physical exercise, and various medicines. Such colic manifests as severe loin pain and can be accompanied by frequent urination, dysuria, oliguria, and haematuria. Documentation of stone characteristics is extremely important: type, size, location, and underlying metabolic abnormalities. Such details can be obtained with a combination of biochemical investigations, microscopic examination of urine under polarised light, and an intravenous pyelogram. Ultrasonography and plain abdominal radiographs are also useful, especially for patients unable to tolerate an intravenous pyelogram. Acute therapy includes complete pain relief, rehydration, and encouragement of diuresis. Long-term management encompasses education of patients with regard to diet and fluid intake, control of calciuria, citrate replacement, and treatment of any underlying urinary-tract infection or metabolic abnormality. Stones smaller than 5 mm normally pass spontaneously, whereas larger stones, as big as 2 cm, are best treated with extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy. All physicians should have a clear understanding of the pathogenesis and clinical management (acute treatment and prevention of recurrence) of renal stone disease. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Two female patients visited our hospital with urinary stone, consisted of ammonium acid urate (AAU). Case 1 : a 25-year-old female who had a history of laxative abuse was treated by extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy. Disintegrated stones were consisted of AAU. Case 2 : an 87-year-old woman was referred to our hospital for investigation of acute urinary retention. She suffered from chronic cystitis. The stone was located within the urethra, a tip of which was seen at the external urethral meatus. The calculus was subsequently dislodged from the urethra using forceps. Stone analysis revealed that the calculus was composed of AAU, magnesium ammonium phosphate and calcium carbonate. It seemed to be essential for the management of AAU to avoid the abuse of laxatives and to treatment of cystitis. © 2004 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam. All rights reserved.

AB  - Therapeutically, magnesium salts represent an important class of compounds and exhibit various pharmacologic actions. Examples of magnesium salts are ionic magnesium and magnesium citrate in nephrolithiasis, magnesium salicylate in rheumatoid arthritis, magnesium hydroxide as an antacid as well as a cathartic, and magnesium mandelate as urinary antiseptic. Various anions attached to the cation magnesium, such as oxide, chloride, gluconate, and lactate, affect the delivery of the amounts of elemental magnesium to the target site and thereby produce different pharmacodynamic effects. This review examines the bioavailability and pharmacokinetics of various magnesium salts and correlates pharmacodynamic action with the structure-activity relationship. © 2001 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Nephrolithiasis secondary to primary hyperparathyroidism infrequently complicates pregnancy. It can cause severe maternal and fetal complications. We present a case of a pregnant woman with nephrolithiasis and primary hyperparathyroidism. We reviewed the management of nephrolithiasis due to primary hyperparathyroidism during pregnancy. We believe that early recognition and timely intervention can significantly reduce the incidence of complications. Copyright © 2001 Elsevier Science Inc. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Obstructive urolithiasis is a common problem in small ruminants and pot-bellied pigs. The most common site of urinary tract obstruction in these species is the urethra. Surgical procedures developed to relieve obstructions, in our experience have been effective in approximately 75% of cases. Urethral stricture is a common complication if the mucosa of the urethra is disrupted. The objective of this project was to evaluate endoscopy guided laser lithotripsy as a therapeutic modality to relieve urethral obstructions in small ruminants and pot-bellied pigs. The study population consisted of patients presented to the Veterinary Medical Teaching Hospital at the University of California Davis with obstructive urolithiasis. Lithotripsy was performed using a Holmium:YAG laser via a 200-micron low water quartz fiber passed through a flexible mini-endoscope. Two types of urinary calculi were managed with this technique, calcium carbonate and calcium hydroxyphosphate. Laser lithotripsy was effective at relieving obstructions caused by both types of calculi when conventional methods had failed. Laser lithotripsy performed via urethral endoscopy is a safe and effective therapeutic modality for management of obstructive in small ruminants and pot bellied pigs and reduces the risk of post procedural urethral stricture. © 2005 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam.

AB  - Although calcium supplementation can cause hypercalciuria, the risk of nephrolithiasis has been shown to decrease rather than increase among subjects who had a higher calcium intake. Hypercalciuria is also a well-established side effect of calcitriol administration. However, the risk of nephrolithiasis is not well defined. The present study was undertaken to prospectively determine the effect of calcium with or without calcitriol on physicochemical risk factors associated with calcium oxalate nephrolithiasis in Thai postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. Subjects consisted of 53 Thai women more than 10 years postmenopausal who were randomly allocated to receive 750 mg of calcium carbonate supplement alone (n = 28) or 750 mg of calcium carbonate plus 0.5 μg calcitriol (n = 25) daily. Mean ± SEM for age was 65.3 ± 1.1 years, body weight 53.5 ± 1.3 kg. Urine samples for biochemical assays were collected at baseline and 3 months after treatment. Supersaturation for calcium oxalate stone formation was assessed from the 24 h urine constituents by the Tiselius's index, AP(CaOx). Three months of calcium supplement alone resulted in a modest, but not significant, increase in urinary calcium (baseline, 2.90 ± 0.43 mmol/day; after treatment 3.58 ± 0.54 mmol/day) with no change in urinary oxalate, citrate or magnesium. In contrast, calcium together with calcitriol caused a significant increase in urinary calcium (baseline, 2.87 ± 0.41 mmol/day; after treatment, 4.08 ± 0.57 mmol/day; p < 0.05). No significant change in other urine constituents after treatment with calcium and calcitriol was detected. Therefore, AP(CaOx) did not significantly increase either after calcium alone (baseline, 1.17 ± 0.39; after treatment, 1.36 ± 0.28) or after calcium plus calcitriol (baseline, 1.09 ± 0.17; after treatment, 1.09 ± 0.19). However, after treatments, 12 subjects (23%) - 6 receiving calcium supplement alone and 6 receiving calcium plus calcitriol supplement - had high AP(CaOx) values (greater than the upper limit of 95% CI for AP(CaOx) derived from non-stone-forming Thai women). The post-treatment/baseline ratio was 3.21 ± 0.74 for urinary calcium, 1.01 ± 0.19 for urinary oxalate, and 2.23 ± 0.42 (median 1.15) for AP(CaOx). The post-treatment/baseline ratio of calcium, but not for urinary oxalate, had a significant correlation with the post-treatment/baseline ratio of AP(CaOx). Our findings suggest that the alteration in the risk of calcium oxalate nephrolithiasis based on urinary composition is related to the alteration in urinary calcium. The risk of calcium oxalate nephrolithiasis does not increase significantly after calcium or combined calcium and calcitriol supplement in the majority of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. © 2008 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.; MEDLINE® is the source for the MeSH terms of this document.

AB  - Patients with low bone density or any prior low trauma fracture should be considered for therapeutic intervention. Oestrogen replacement therapy remains the first choice for prevention of bone loss in early postmenopausal women with low bone density. In postmenopausal women with existing fractures, the rank order of treatments is firstly alendronate, secondly raloxifene and thirdly less potent bisphosphonates, such as etidronate, or active vitamin D metabolites, such as calcitriol. For men with osteoporosis, if hypogonadism is present, it should be treated with testosterone replacement therapy. Despite limited data, a bisphosphonate should then be considered in conjunction with calcium. Supplementation with simple vitamin D should be considered in elderly patients who are housebound or live in institutions, as they are at risk of vitamin D deficiency and osteomalacia. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - We report a new case of silica urolithiasis in a 71-year-old patient with background of medicament ingesta (antacid) which could justify the formation of these calculi with so uncommon composition. Medicament calculi amounts about 1% from total urinary calculi. Among them, silica ones (silicon dioxide or Si O2) have been relate din their etiology to chronical ingest of antacid drugs, specially those with magnesium trisilicate. Silica formation in urine is facilitated and conditioned by an acid pH of it. Diagnosis and therapeutical approach does not change in relation to other lithiasis with similar dimension or location. After its composition report, and ruling out the possibility for patient's malingering, urine alkalinization was applied, with an excellent follow-up afterwards. The antacid was substituted by other drug. We analyze the most important aspects about this case. We also make reference to the main related bibliography. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The effects of calcium supplementation on urinary oxalate excretion was tested in 9 normal subjects, 4 males and 5 females between 23 and 49 years of age. In a crossover study 800 mg calcium was orally administered as active absorbable algal calcium (AAACa) (A) and calcium carbonate (B), and compared with non-calcium containing placebo (C). Calcium, oxalate, osmolality, creatinine and pH were measured in the first three morning urine samples and Ca/osmolality, Ca/osmolality/body weight, Ca/creatinine and oxalate/osmolality were calculated to correct for urine dilution. Ca x oxalate product was also calculated and Ca oxalate crystal in the sediment was microscopically examined and semiquantitatively estimated as -, +, ++, and +++ expressed as 0, 1, 2 and 3 respectively. Urinary Ca excretion was similar in A and B, but significantly larger than C, regardless of the method of correction for dilution. Urinary oxalate excretion tended to be lower in A than in B and C. Urine pH was similar among all three groups. Ca x oxalate product was higher in C than in A and B. AAACa, unlike calcium carbonate, appeared to decrease urinary oxalate excretion and Ca x oxalate product more efficiently than Ca carbonate, suggesting a possibility of inhibiting the formation of Ca x oxalate kidney stones. Formation of calcium oxalate was also tested in vitro by adding oxalate to urine samples and aqueous calcium solution.

AB  - A captive 5-yr-old castrated male Rocky Mountain wapiti (Cervus elaphus nelsoni) developed stranguria. Rectal palpation and physical examination indicated urethral obstruction that was subsequently relieved by urethrostomy and required only minimal aftercare. The wapiti was able to urinate freely after surgery; however, the obstruction recurred 27 mo later. Urethral catheterization relieved the second obstruction, which was caused by a large calculus composed of calcium carbonate and magnesium carbonate. Urolithiasis may have been associated with a diet high in calcium, and urethral obstruction may have been associated with castration at an early age. The wapiti continued to urinate freely 9 mo after relief of the second obstruction and 3 yr after the initial surgery. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Stone disease is as old as recorded history but despite advances in diagnosis and treatment, it continues to cause significant morbidity. This review summarises the current pharmacologic management of urinary calculi based upon the stone type. All patients with stone disease are advised to increase fluid intake, limit dietary protein and limit sodium. Calcium oxalate stones can be managed on a selective or non-selective basis depending on the cause of the hypercalciuria or hyperoxaluria. Agents currently in use include sodium cellulose phosphate, thiazides, orthophosphates, oral calcium supplements, pyridoxine, cholestyramine, citrate, magnesium and allopurinol. Classically, struvite stones occur in the presence of urea splitting organisms and are composed of magnesium, ammonium phosphate and carbonate apatite. The goal of treatment is to make patients stone free as bacteria retained in stone fragments lead to stone growth. Urease inhibitors, aluminium hydroxide gel, hemiacidrin, and Suby G and M solutions are infrequently used in treatment. Cystine stones are the result of an autosomal recessive disorder. D-Penicillamine, captopril and α-mercaptopropionylglycine (MPG) are all oral agents that have proven to be efficacious. As more randomised trials are conducted and the understanding of endogenous stone inhibitors progresses, the medical management of stone disease will continue to improve. 2000 © Ashley Publications Ltd. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Aim To investigate the relationship between calcium acetate as supplement and kidney stone by giving calcium acetate to the experimental rats both with normal physiological condition and with abnormal oxalate metabolism. METHODS: Observations of the stone formation were made after 8 week feeding of Wistar rats with calcium acetate and classical calcium supplement-calcium carbonate. RESULTS: In the experimental condition, calcium acetate did not induce kidney stone in rats with normal physiological condition, however, an increased risk was observed in the animals with abnormal oxalate metabolism. CONCLUSION: Calcium acetate is a safe calcium supplement when it is used property; oxalate-rich food should be avoided at the time of calcium supplementation. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Purpose: Urinary oxalate is a primary determinant of the level of calcium oxalate saturation and the formation of calcium oxalate crystals, a key event in kidney stone formation. The primary objective of this study was to compare the effects of calcium carbonate and magnesium oxide on oxalate absorption. Materials and Methods: An experimental model was used that allowed differentiation between endogenously and oxalate load-derived urinary oxalate. Twenty-four healthy subjects (10 males, 14 females) participated in three oxalate load (OL) tests: control (OL alone), calcium carbonate (OL with concomitant calcium carbonate ingestion), and magnesium oxide (OL with concomitant magnesium oxide ingestion). Oxalate loads consisted of 180 mg. unlabeled and 18 mg. 1,2[13C<inf>2</inf>] oxalic acid. Timed urine samples were collected after the OL for analysis of oxalate, calcium, magnesium, and creatinine. Results: Both the calcium carbonate and magnesium oxide treatments were associated with significantly lower load-derived oxalate levels at all time points within the initial 24-hour post-oxalate ingestion period compared with levels observed for the control treatment. There were no treatment effects on endogenous oxalate levels. The efficiency of oxalate absorption for the calcium carbonate (5.1%) and magnesium oxide (7.6%) treatments was significantly lower than that for the control treatment (13.5%). Conclusions: The results suggested that magnesium was nearly as effective as calcium in reducing oxalate absorption and urinary excretion. Higher levels of urinary oxalate, calcium, and magnesium in males appeared to be largely a function of body size since gender differences either disappeared or were reversed when a correction was made for urinary creatinine excretion. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Background and Purpose: The treatment of cystine stones is a clinical problem. This in vitro study was performed to establish an experimental system that enables standardized and reproducible investigations on chemolysis of cystine stones to look for an improvement of dissolution strategies. Materials and Methods: Artificial spherical stones made of cystine (BON(N)-STONES) with a diameter of 0.9 cm were used. A new dissolution device was developed simulating the physiological conditions in the upper urinary tract with computer-assisted online measurement of data. For chemolysis of artificial cystine stones, different solvents (artificial urine, physiologic sodium chloride solution, 2% acetylcysteine, 8.4% sodium bicarbonate solution, THAM, and combinations) were used. Results: Chemolysis is an effective tool in the management of cystine stone disease. Statistical analysis showed significant differences (p ≤ 0.05) for all solutions compared with artificial urine alone. A combination of THAM at pH 10 with acetylcysteine (2%) showed a 48-fold stronger ability to dissolve cystine calculi than did artificial urine. Conclusion: By performing standardized in vitro investigations, new basics to improve the dissolution of cystine stones have been developed. It is recommended to use artificial stones made of cystine and a dissolution device simulating physiological conditions for investigations on chemolysis in the future. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - In nine normal subjects, four men and five women between 23 and 49 years of age, 800mg calcium was orally administered as active absorbable algal calcium (AAA Ca) (A) and calcium carbonate (CaCO<inf>3</inf>) (B), to compare with non-calcium-containing placebo (C) in a crossover design. Calcium, oxalate, osmolality, creatinine, and pH were measured in the first three morning urine samples and Ca/osmolality, Ca/osmolality/body weight, Ca/creatinine, and oxalate/ osmolality were calculated to correct for urine dilution. Ca x oxalate product was also calculated, and Ca oxalate crystal in the sediment was microscopically examined, semiquantitatively estimated as -, +, ++, or +++, and numerically expressed as 0, 1, 2, or 3, respectively. Urinary Ca excretion was similar in groups A and B, but significantly larger than in group C, regardless of the method of correction for dilution. Urinary oxalate excretion with correction for osmolality, however, was significantly lower in A than in B and C, which gave similar values. Urine pH was similar among all three groups. Ca x oxalate product was significantly higher in C than in A, but A and B were not significantly different. AAA Ca appeared to decrease urinary oxalate excretion and Ca x oxalate product more efficiently than CaCO<inf>3</inf>, suggesting the possibility of inhibiting the formation of Ca x oxalate kidney stones. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The article contains a review of renal and urinary tract calculosis the equine species and its surgically treatable cases. Changes of the kidneys and of the urinary tract are rare in horses. Though they pass considerable amounts of calcium carbonate in their urine, nevertheless only a small number of horses are affected by urolithiasis. Descriptions of operative procedures are given with particular attention paid to the difficulties in their execution and to possible compications. In addition, case reports given include two nephrectomies, a ureterectomy, a cystotomy and a urethrotomy. All cases healed with success. It is concluded that specific urological diagnosis of the disorders of the urinary tract is often difficult. Surgical interventions, especially nephrectomy and ureterectomy require a lot of experience, good qualifications and surgical skills. © 2004 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam. All rights reserved.

AB  - Drug-induced urolithiasis are observed in 1.6% of the urinary calculi in France. Drugs crystals are identified in two thirds of these stones. Other drugs are responsible for stones which have an apparent metabolic origin (one third of the cases). Stone analysis using physical methods such as infrared spectroscopy is needed to unambiguously identify stones containing drugs. The inquiry is an important step to identify lithogenetic drugs which do not crystallize in the stones. The main substances which were identified in stones over the past decade were indinavir monohydrate (31.4%). triamterene (11.1%), sulphonamides (10.5%) and amorphous silica (4.5%). The main drugs involved in the nucleation and growth of metabolic stones were calcium and vitamin D supplementation (15%) and long-term treatment with carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (8%). Stone prevention is based on drug withdrawal or change in dosage with additional measures including an increase of diuresis and, if necessary, changes in the urine pH. © 2008 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Prevalence and incidence of urinary lithiasis are increasing in western countries. Oxalocalcic stone is the major form of urinary calculi but other forms are not unusual. Characteristics of the collected stone may improve the diagnosis investigations. Rational blood and urine examinations are essential for this medical management. Most of the various metabolic abnormalities in cause can be corrected from specific dietary measures. © 2004 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam. All rights reserved.

AB  - Cystine urolithiasis is the only clinical expression of cystinuria, an autosomal recessive genetic defect of the transepithelial transport of cystine and other dibasic amino acids in the kidney. Stones form due to the increased excretion of cystine, which is poorly soluble at normal urine pH. Cystine stones are often resistent to extracorporeal shack wave lithotripsy, so that percutaneous surgery or ureteroscopy are the preferred techniques of stone extraction. Medical preventative treatment is based on high diuresis (≥ 1.5 l/m2 per day) well distributed throughout the day and night, and urine alkalinization up to pH 7.5 by means of sodium bicarbonate and/or potassium citrate. When these basal measures are ineffective at preventing stone recurrence or dissolving pre-existing stones, sulfhydryl agents such as D-penicillamine or tiopronin, which form highly soluble mixed disulfides with cystine moieties, are to be added to urine dilution and alkalinization, especially when cystine excretion is in excess of 750 mg/day (3 mmol/day). Frequent clinical and ultrasound follow-up is needed to encourage patient compliance and assess efficacy and tolerance of treatment. © 2007 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.; Medline is the source for the MeSH terms of this document.

AB  - Background and Objective: Evidence is presented that the fragmentation process of long-pulse Holmium:YAG (Ho:YAG) lithotripsy is governed by photothermal decomposition of the calculi rather than photomechanical or photoacoustical mechanisms as is widely thought. The clinical Ho:YAG laser lithotriptor (2.12 μm, 250 μs) operates in the free-running mode, producing pulse durations much longer than the time required for a sound wave to propagate beyond the optical penetration depth of this wave-length in water. Hence, it is unlikely that shock waves are produced during bubble formation. In addition, the vapor bubble induced by this laser is not spherical. Thus the magnitude of the pressure wave produced at cavitation collapse does not contribute significantly to lithotripsy. Study Design/Materials and Methods: A fast-flash photography setup was used to capture the dynamics of urinary calculus fragmentation at various delay times following the onset of the Ho:YAG laser pulse. These images were concurrently correlated with pressure measurements obtained with a piezoelectric polyvinylidene-fluoride needle- hydrophone. Stone mass-loss measurements for ablation of urinary calculi (1) in air (dehydrated and hydrated) and in water, and (2) at pre-cooled and at room temperatures were compared. Chemical and composition analyses were performed on the ablation products of several types of Ho:YAG laser irradiated urinary calculi, including calcium oxalate monohydrate (COM), calcium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate (CHPD), magnesium ammonium phosphate hexahydrate (MAPH), cystine, and uric acid calculi. Results: When the optical fiber was placed perpendicularly in contact with the surface of the target, fast-flash photography provided visual evidence that ablation occurred approximately 50 μs after the initiation of the Ho:YAG laser pulse (250-350 μs duration; 375-400 mJ per pulse), long before the collapse of the cavitation bubble. The measured peak acoustical pressure upon cavitation collapse was negligible (< 2 bars), indicating that photomechanical forces were not responsible for the observed fragmentation process. When the fiber was placed in parallel to the calculus surface, the pressure peaks occurring at the collapse of the cavitation were on the order of 20 bars, but no fragmentation occurred. Regardless of fiber orientation, no shock waves were recorded at the beginning of bubble formation. Ablation of COM calculi (a total of 150 J; 0.5 J per pulse at an 8-Hz repetition rate) revealed different Ho:YAG efficiencies for dehydrated calculus, hydrated calculus, and submerged calculus. COM and cystine calculi, pre-cooled at -80°C and then placed in water, yielded lower mass-loss during ablation (20 J, 1.0 J per pulse) compared to the mass-loss of calculi at room temperature. Chemical analyses of the ablated calculi revealed products resulting from thermal decomposition. Calcium carbonate was found in samples composed of COM calculi; calcium pyrophosphate was found in CHPD samples; free sulfur and cysteine were discovered in samples composed of cysteine samples; and cyanide was found in samples of uric acid calculi. Conclusion: These experimental results provide convincing evidence that long-pulse Ho:YAG laser lithotripsy causes chemical decomposition of urinary calculi as a consequence of a dominant photothermal mechanism. © 2007 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.; Medline is the source for the MeSH terms of this document.

AB  - Alkaptonuria is a rare disease of phenylalanine, aromatic amino acids, and tyrosine metabolism. Because of a genetic deficiency of the enzyme homogentisic acid oxidase, an accumulation of homogentisic acid causes ochronotic pigment deposition. The most common clinical manifestations are arthropathy, urinary calculi and discoloration, cutaneous and cartilaginous pigmentation, and cardiac valvular disease. Arthropathy and aortic stenosis are the most debilitating manifestations of the disease. A case of alkaptonuric aortic stenosis is described. A 75-year-old woman with a history of alkaptonuria presented in the emergency department with complaints of progressive dyspnea. Upon examination, the patient was hypertensive, tachypneic, and tachycardic with premature ventricular contractions. She had pitting edema of the lower extremities and complaints of generalized weakness. Chest x-rays revealed congestive heart failure and pulmonary edema. Diuretics were administered, and a continuous nitroglycerin infusion was initiated in the emergency department. The patient was admitted for further evaluation. The patient's respiratory status continued to decline. She was intubated endotracheally 1 day after admission. Subsequent cardiac evaluation revealed an ejection fraction of 35%, severe aortic stenosis, mild coronary artery disease, ischemic cardiomyopathy, and anteroapical akinesis. A dobutamine infusion was instituted for persistent hypotension, and renal dose dopamine was initiated for oliguric renal failure. The patient underwent an emergency operation for an aortic valve replacement with a Dacron patch 10 days after admission. Cardiopulmonary bypass and mild hypothermia were used during the procedure. The patient's hemodynamic status remained tenuous throughout the procedure. Although the first attempt to wean off cardiopulmonary bypass failed, the second attempt was successful with the aid of an intra-aortic balloon pump, inotropic support, and atrioventricular pacing. These measures were maintained during transport to the surgical intensive care unit. In the intensive care unit, the patient did not have an audible blood pressure or a palpable pulse without the support of the intra-aortic balloon pump and atrioventricular pacing. Coarse atrial fibrillation was the underlying electrocardiogram rhythm in the absence of atrioventricular pacing. Sodium bicarbonate was given without improvement. After discussion with the family, all life support measures were discontinued. The patient died 10 minutes after her arrival in the intensive care unit. Alkaptonuria's pathogenesis is manifested as both local and systemic in nature. Collagen vascular diseases share a similar pattern of multisystem involvement. Despite the negative outcome for the patient described, valuable insight can be obtained by studying this case and noting the anesthetic considerations specific to collagen vascular diseases in general. © 2007 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.; Medline is the source for the MeSH terms of this document.

AB  - Etiological factors and pathogenetic mechanisms were studied in 538 patients with nephrolithiasis. By composition of uroliths and salts, all the patients were divided into groups by types of urolithiasis (oxalate, urate, phosphate, cystic and mixed). After elimination of the uroliths using different methods, metaphylaxis of nephrolithiasis was conducted in all the patients. It varied with type of lithogenesis, etiology and pathogenesis. Antirecurrence therapy included diet with restriction of lithogenic substances, endogenic reduction of lithogenic metabolites and measures to decrease and block crystallization and lithogenesis. The treatment has diminished the incidence of recurrences from 32.3 to 9.6% (total), from 14.4 to 5.3% (in oxalate type), 47.2 to 16.9% (in phosphate type), 39.7 to 6.7% (in urate type), 40.5 to 17.7% (in mixed type). © 2015 Medline is the source for the citation and abstract of this record.

AB  - Objective: A series of experiments were conducted to test the hypothesis that the mechanism of holmium:YAG lithotripsy is photothermal. Methods and Results: To show that holmium:YAG lithotripsy requires direct absorption of optical energy, stone loss was compared for 150 J Ho:YAG lithotripsy of calcium oxalate monohydrate (COM) stones for hydrated stones irradiated in water (17 ± 3 mg) and hydrated stones irradiated in air (25 ± 9 mg) v dehydrated stones irradiated in air (40 ± 12 mg) (P < 0.001). To show that Ho:YAG lithotripsy occurs prior to vapor bubble collapse, the dynamics of lithotripsy in water and vapor bubble formation were documented with video flash photography. Holmium:YAG lithotripsy began at 60 μsec, prior to vapor bubble collapse. To show that Ho:YAG lithotripsy is fundamentally related to stone temperature, cystine, and COM mass loss was compared for stones initially at room temperature (~ 23°C) v frozen stones ablated within 2 minutes after removal from the freezer. Cystine and COM mass losses were greater for stones starting at room temperature than cold (P ≤ 0.05). To show that Ho:YAG lithotripsy involves a thermochemical reaction, composition analysis was done before and after lithotripsy. Postlithotripsy, COM yielded calcium carbonate; cystine yielded cysteine and free sulfur; calcium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate yielded calcium pyrophosphate; magnesium ammonium phosphate yielded ammonium carbonate and magnesium carbonate; and uric acid yielded cyanide. To show that Ho:YAG lithotripsy does not create significant shockwaves, pressure transients were measured during lithotripsy using needle hydrophones. Peak pressures were < 2 bars. Conclusion: The primary mechanism of Ho:YAG lithotripsy is photothermal. There are no significant photoacoustic effects. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Two types of canine struvite uroliths have been recognized: infection- induced struvite is the most common type; sterile struvite is uncommonly recognized. Infection-induced struvite is most commonly associated with urease-producing staphylococcal UTI. For dogs that qualify, medical dissolution is an effective method of treatment. Medical dissolution protocols encompass: (1) eradication or control of UTI; (2) use of calculolytic diets; and (3) administration of urease inhibitors to patients with persistent UTI caused by urease-producing microbes. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Diagnostic and therapeutic drugs may enhance urolithiasis in one or a combination of ways, including: (1) alteration of urine pH in such fashion as to create an environment that increases the solubility of some lithogenic substances, (2) alteration of glomerular filtration rate, tubular reabsorption, and tubular secretion of drugs of endogenous substances so as to enhance promoters or impair inhibitors of urolithiasis, and (3) precipitation (e.g., drugs or their metabolites) to form a portion or all of a urolith. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - A 26-year-old female visited our hospital complaining left flank pain and macroscopic hematuria. She had been suffering ulcerative colitis and administered salazosulphapyridine and predonisolone from 17-year-old. Intravenous urography showed radiolucent multiple stones in the left renal pelvis. Three sessions of extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy were performed after ureteral stenting. Although disintegration and discharge of the stones were satisfactory, bladder stone induced by ureteral stent was complicated. The extracted bladder stone showed a yellowish brown color and the surface was granular shape. Composition of the stone was acetyl sulphapyridine which was a metabolite of salazosulphapyridine. After maintenance of the urinary pH ranges between 6.5 and 7.5 by medication of sodium bicarbonate, the patient remains free of stone for 3 years. Drug induced urolithiasis originated from salazosulphapyridine is extremely rare. Satisfactory oral fluid intake and urinary alkalization are important for prevention of sulpha drugs calculi of urinary tract. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Over the past 3 years, the treatment and prognosis of HIV-1 infection have been revolutionized by a better understanding of the pathogenesis of HIV-1 infection, the ability to monitor viral replication and drug resistance in the host, and the availability of potent combination chemotherapy. While most of the studies that have led to this transformation have been done in adults, the results can be applied to the care of children. Data from trials of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in children are now being presented or published. Although the basic principles of antiretroviral therapy of HIV-1 infection do not differ between adults and children, there are important differences in the natural history of the disease and in issues related to medication administration and adherence to therapy. Progression of disease may be more rapid in children and is often very rapid in infants. Administration of medication to infants and children can be difficult, especially when the medication tastes bad. Finally, whereas an adult patient is free to decline therapy, however foolish such a decision may seem to the health-care professional, the failure to administer effective medication to a child for a condition that threatens serious morbidity or death constitutes medical neglect. In this review we will discuss the basic principles underlying pediatric antiretroviral therapy and address the issue of adherence, the major impediment to treatment success. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - It has usually been assumed that the analysis of recovered renal stones should be routinely done. This concept has recently been challenged. Very little work has been done to correlate analytical results with clinical findings and the impact of this information on clinical management. This paper reviews current concepts of stone formation, how this information can be used to interpret stone analysis results and how stone analyses results can be used in clinical-decision-making. © 2007 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.; Medline is the source for the MeSH terms of this document.

AB  - Objective Tb determine whether dietary calcium supplements given to healthy, pregnant, nulliparous women reduces the risk for pre-eclampsia. Design Randomised, double-blind, placebocontrolled trial (Calcium for Preeclampsia Prevention [CPEP] trial). Setting 5 medical centres in the United States. Patients 11 959 women were screened, and 4589 (mean age 21 y) were enrolled. Inclusion criteria were gestation of 13 to 21 weeks, normal pregnancy and blood pressure, and absence of proteinuria. Exclusion criteria were pre-existing disease; situations that would affect end points, absorption of calcium, or compliance; renal disease; haematuria; personal or family history of urolithiasis; elevated serum creatinine or calcium concentrations; or frequent use of calcium supplements or antacids. Intervention After a 6- to 14-day run-in period to check compliance, 2295 women were allocated to calcium, 2 g/d of elemental calcium as calcium carbonate in chewable tablets. 2 2 94 women were allocated to placebo. Main outcome measures Pregnancy-associated hypertension; pregnancy-associated proteinuria; preeclampsia defined as pregnancy-associated hypertension and pregnancy-associated proteinuria documented within 7 days of each other; eclampsia or die HELLP syndrome (hemolysis, elevated liver enzyme levels, and low platelet count) with pregnancy-associated hypertension; preterm delivery; gestational age at delivery; small-for-gestational-age births; perinatal mortality; and urolithiasis. Main results Calcium supplementation was associated with a lower rate for a combined outcome of hypertensive disorders (preeclampsia and pregnancy-associated hypertension without pre-eclampsia) (P = 0.05) but with no difference for any other outcome, including preeclampsia (6.9% vs 7.3%, {P = 0.6}*), pregnancy-associated hypertension without pre-eclampsia (15.3% vs 17.3%, [P = 0.07}*), pregnancy-associated proteinuria without hypertension (3.4% TO 3.3%, {P=0.9}*, eclampsia, the HELLP syndrome, preterm or post-term delivery, premature rupture of membranes, induction of labour, caesarean delivery, placental abruption, renal insufficiency, cerebral haemorrhage, disseminated intravascular coagulation, urolithiasis, gestational age at delivery, birth weight or length, Apgar scores, admission to neonatal intensive care unit, or perinatal losses. Conclusion Calcium supplements during normal pregnancy did not prevent pre-eclampsia, related disorders, or adverse perinatal outcomes. © 2006 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Two cases of silica stones, without previous oral intake of magnesium trisilicate, are reported. A 64-year-old Japanese woman had bilateral renal stones. Infrared spectrophotoscopy revealed that one of the fragments consisted of silicate and the others consisted of calcium oxalate. A 75-year-old woman had right renal stones. The composition of 1 stone was a mixture of silicate and unspecified matrices. Silicate urolithiasis may not necessarily be related to oral intake of silicate-containing antacids. © 2007 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.; Medline is the source for the MeSH terms of this document.

AB  - We report a case of urolithiasis caused by surgical treatment for Crohn's disease. A 28-year-old woman was referred to our department for further examination of renal stones from the medical department in September, 1995. She suffered from Crohn's disease and had a history of jejuno-ileal resection because of perforation of the ileum in 1988. Radiographs revealed multiple bilateral renal stones, and the urine oxalate concentration was elevated. She was treated with extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy and the administration of sodium bicarbonate and citrate, but these treatments did not prevent recurrence and enlargement of stones. Renal function was gradually worsened and we performed transurethral lithotomy and percataneous nephrolithotripsy. The stones were mainly composed of oxalate calcium monohydrate. A renal biopsy was performed at the operation, showing deposition of crystals in almost all renal tubules. Diet therapy (low oxalate and low fat) and the administration of sodium bicarbonate and citrate were perfomed strictly and recurrence was not recognized 10 months after complete removal of the stones. © 2012 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Background. Hydropinic therapy in renal stone disease is a major preventive approach. Usually, at least two litres of water are administered daily to accomplish urine dilution and mobilization of small calculi, especially in the interval between meals. Aim of this study was to examine the effects on solute excretion in normal subjects of two different waters: (A) oligomineral water (Ca, 16 mg/l, Fiuggi®); (B) calcium carbonate alkaline water (Ca, 380 mg/l). Methods. Waters were administered during the day in amounts of 2 litres to subjects assuming equilibrated diets containing 800-900 mg of calcium. The period of administration was of two weeks. Twenty- one normal volunteers entered the study, 11 males (39±3 years old) and 10 females (37±4 years old). They were divided into two groups each drinking either (A) or (B). Results. Diuresis increased in both groups reaching levels of 2800±880 and 2590±708 ml/day respectively. A significant (p<0.015) increase in calcium excretion was observed only in Group 2, drinking water (B) from 147±57 to 214±91 mg/day. An increase in phosphate and citrate excretion was observed with both waters. A fall in calcium/citrate ratio was also observed. As to oxalate excretion, a slight increment was observed with both waters. In addition, the CaxOx product increased in the subjects receiving water B. Conclusions. In conclusion, oligomineral water administered mainly in the intervals between meals, in normal subjects receiving normal calcium diets, does not produce an increase in oxalate excretion above that observed with calcium carbonate alkaline water, while keeping 24 hr calcium excretion unmodified contrarily to calcium carbonate alkaline water. Therefore, while on oligomineral water, the risk of stone formation should be reduced also in patients with calcium stone disease. © 2004 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam. All rights reserved.

AB  - Recent advances in understanding the molecular level mechanisms that control biomineralization and organic-inorganic interactions in urolithiasis are reviewed, and the validity of drawing parallels between them are considered. The multifunctional nature of many biomineralization molecules, particularly proteins, and the different roles they play in and out of solution suggest avenues for resolving the apparent paradox that urinary macromolecules have been observed both to inhibit and to promote stone formation. © 2007 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Objective. To study, using an in vitro model, the early phases of deposition of urinary components onto the surface of calcium-salt crystals treated with physiological and alkaline urine. Materials and methods. Calcium carbonate, oxalate and phosphate crystals were incubated in either freshly collected 'physiological' urine (pH 5.5) or with urine at pH 8.0. The surface conditioning was characterized using sodium-dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis immunoblot profiles of the adsorbed proteins and by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Crystal morphology and aggregation were assessed using scanning electron microscopy. Results. The patterns of protein adsorption from physiological urine showed the ubiquitous adsorption of bands within 51-86 kDa, while Tamm-Horsfall protein (THP) and alphal-microglobulin were found only in calcium oxalate crystals. Less aggregation was detected in calcium oxalate and phosphate crystals treated in urine at pH 5.5, while a new crystalline phase was deposited on calcium carbonate surfaces. Incubation in alkaline urine led to changes in the protein electrophoretic profiles, with a significant variation in the morphology of the inorganic phase only in calcium phosphate crystals. Conclusions. The binding of urinary proteins onto crystals depends on the chemistry of the surface and on the physicochemical composition of the urine. THP, albumin, alphal-microglobulin and a 20 kDa protein were able to bind calcium crystals under different circumstances. Except for THP, there was no clear relationship between the adsorption of proteins on crystals and the re-arrangement of the inorganic phase. © 2007 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.; Medline is the source for the MeSH terms of this document.

AB  - More than 500 uroliths from dogs, cats, minks, rabbits and 9 further animal species originating from various regions of former East Germany were analysed. The observations were made between 1980 and 1989 using X-ray diffraction and infrared spectroscopy. The urinary stones consisted of struvite, whewellite, weddelute, cystine, ammonium urate, brushite, whitlockite, hydroxyapatite or carbonate-apatite, calcium carbonate, silicium dioxide and organic matrix stones. In dogs, the most frequent types were struvite and apatite concrements, followed by calcium oxalate and cystine uroliths. Among the diseased animals poodles, dachshunds and terriers ranked first. In the analysed material from cats apatite and struvite predominated. With few exceptions, minks formed struvite uroliths only. The analysed calculi from rabbits consisted principally of calcium phosphate or calcium carbonate concrements. The present analysis has been compared with results of former studies, differences are discussed. © 2012 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Background. While in vitro the protective effect of magnesium on calcium oxalate crystallization is well known, its clinical relevance in calcium nephrolithiasis is still debated. Therefore, the clinical and metabolic effects of magnesium hydroxide therapy were evaluated in calcium stone formers. Methods. Nine patients (7 M, 2 F), selected for a low urinary magnesium excretion (uMg 56 ± 12 mg/day), were given Mg hydroxide (500 mg/day), with clinical and metabolic controls at 3, 12 and 18 months. Results. Urinary Mg/u Creat increased throughout the study; uOx/uCreat decreased significantly; uCa/uCreat increased but not significantly. The stone recurrence rate decreased from 0.75 to 0.11 stones/year/patient, throughout the study period. The decrease of uOx is considered a more important risk factor in calcium stone patients than a similar uCa change; it may be due to a reduced intestinal Ox absorption, for the formation of insoluble and not absorbed Mg oxalate. Conclusion. In conclusion, Mg hydroxide therapy was encouraging in patients with calcium nephrolithiasis and low uMg; nevertheless a longer period of treatment is needed to confirm these data. © 2007 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.; Medline is the source for the MeSH terms of this document.

AB  - Significant prevalence: Lithiasis within the urinary tract is caused by drugs in 1.5 to 2% of the cases. Calculi may be composed of the drug itself because of its poor solubility in urine or result from the drug's metabolic effect favoring stone formation. Drugs may induce lithiasis formation directly or simply contribute to growth of existing calculi. Main drug categories: Predominant drugs implicated include triamterene, glafenine, piridoxilate, sulfadiazine and indinavir as well as poorly-controlled calcium and vitamin D supplementation. Other drugs are occasionally involved, particularly some antibiotics and antiseptics. Diagnosis and prevention: Certain drug-induced lithiases are no longer encountered (glafenine, piridoxilate) while others have reappeared (sulfadiazine) or been recently described (ceftriaxone, amoxicillin, opaline silica in the young child, indinavir). Physical analysis of the calculi using reliable methods such as infrared spectrophotometry and history taking to identify drug use are essential for diagnosis. In order to reduce the frequency of lithiasis complications, specific risk factors for developing drug-induced lithiasis should be recognized and taken into consideration when prescribing long-term drug regimens. In all cases, an increased diuresis should be envisaged. © 2004 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam. All rights reserved.

AB  - The pathophysiology of stone disorder in older adults, as compared to their younger counterparts, has not been thoroughly investigated. This article examines the differences in serum and urine chemistries between groups that are younger and older than 60 years of age. The principal finding is that stone formation occurs at lower urinary supersaturation in older patients, suggesting that other unexplored factors are significant contributors. The authors then review the possible effect of age on the morbidity of stone disease and the implications of stone disease for the development and management of osteoporosis. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Drugs can cause renal stone formation either by raising excretion rates of naturally occurring stone components or by directly precipitating within the urinary tract. In large series of analysed renal stones, the overall frequency of drug-induced urolithiasis is less than 0.5%. Five clinical presentations of drug-induced crystallization in the kidneys can be recognized: asymptomatic crystalluria, symptomatic crystalluria; stone passage; obstructive uropathy and tubulointerstitial nephritis. In the current literature review, the protease inhibitors used for treatment of patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus stand out as a new class of drugs that frequently causes crystallization within the urinary tract. The most widely used compound, indinavir, may lead to crystalluria and renal stone formation in up to 50% of patients, and occasionally also causes acute renal failure caused by obstructive uropathy or tubulointerstitial nephritis. On the other hand, ritonavir appears more often to induce (reversible) acute renal failure than stone formation. © 2004 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objective: To provide a concise review of the current approach to the clinical use of the available drugs for HIV infection. Data sources: Recent 'state of the art' publications and key reference articles. Conclusions: Prognostic and monitoring parameters for HIV infection have been established based on new insights into the life-cycle of HIV and novel virologic techniques. Three groups of antiretrovirals are now available for general use. Familiarity with these drugs, their pharmacokinetics, side effects, and drug-drag interactions, as well as with the specific milieu of each individual patient is crucial for the successful management of HIV infection. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - It is now generally accepted that mono- and bitherapy for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection are only transiently efficient mainly due to virus drug resistance. To obtain a sustained benefit from antiviral therapy, current guidelines recommend at least triple-drug combinations, or the so-called highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). In some patients, HAART can be problematic, either because it is difficult to remain compliant or because previous suboptimum therapies have limited the choice of drugs. For compliant drug-naive patients, HAART should be able to offer long-term virus suppression, when changing from first- to second- to third-line HAART at drug failure. Long-term treatment might ultimately result in multi-drug resistant virus leaving few options for salvage therapy. HIV drug resistance testing to guide this salvage therapy and the development of new drugs to allow new options will therefore remain priorities in anti-HIV drug research. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Renal stone disease has been regarded as an uncommon problem in children compared to adults. However, increased awareness of this problem in children may lead to early intervention preventing long-term consequences on the kidney and the urinary tract. This article reviews the epidemiology, pathogenesis, and the most common etiologies of renal stones in children. The clinical features and diagnostic and therapeutic modalities for the specific etiologies are also outlined. Using these guidelines may be helpful not only in the treatment but also in the prevention of renal stones. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - During 1989 to 1996 20 cases of urolithiasis in guinea pigs were diagnosed. 15 (75%) of the animals were female, the mean age of guinea pigs with urolithiasis was 4.6 years. In five males and two females cystic calculi were diagnosed, in 13 female guinea pigs calculi were located in the urethra near the ostium urethrae externum. Three urethral calculi were removed by forceps, one by palpation manipulation, the rest surgically by cystotomy or urethrotomy. According to the results of infrared spectroscopy, calculi consisted of two or more minerals. Except of two all stones contained calcium carbonate, 12 calcium phospate and three calcium oxalate. In 10 cases the calculi contained masses of struvite. Urethral calculi should be considered in the differential diagnosis of female guinea pigs in cases of hematuria and in cases of unremarkable clinical examination. © 2012 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Urolithiasis is the third most common affliction of the urinary tract, after infections and diseases of the prostate. Approximately 10% of the North American populations will have at least one urinary calculus by age 70. A thourough history and physical examination will usually confirm the diagnosis of urinary stone disease. A simplified laboratory evaluation may be performed for patients with a single stone episode. A more extensive evaluation is required for patients with recurrent, metabolically active stones and patients at high risk (ie, cystine stone formers and those who develop bladder dysfunction or nephosclerosis). Intravenous pyelography with tomography with remains the gold standard for imaging of the urinary tract to confirm the diagnosis and formulate a treatment plan. © 2007 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.; Medline is the source for the MeSH terms of this document.

AB  - Primary hyperparathyroidism, characterized by hypersecretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH) leading to hypercalcemia and relative hypophosphatemia, is quite common in the elderly. Most patients with primary hyperparathyroidism have only mild hypercalcemia and are symptomless. But others experience various other organ diseases. Primary hyperparathyroidism is also associated with cardiovascular abnormalities, including QT interval shortening, heart block, cardiac arrhythmias, hypertension, myocardial hypertrophy, myocardial calcification and, though rarely, with valvular heart disease. We described a case of primary hyperparathyroidism associated with cardiac abnormalities. An 82-year-old male presented with the complaints of chest discomfort, fatigue, general weakness, nausea and vomiting over a period of months and was admitted in July 1996. Physical examination with heart auscultation showed a pansystolic murmur over the right sternal border and apex region, and a blowing diastolic murmur over the left sternal border. Biochemistry profiles revealed elevations of serum calcium (14.3 mg/dl) and chloride/phosphate ratio (> 33). Endocrinological studies showed elevations of serum PTH-C (4.8 ng/ml) and PTH-intact (705 pg/ml) concentrations. Kidney ultrasonography revealed a left renal stone. A spine X-ray revealed spondylosis and a compression fracture of the lumbar-spine with osteoporotic change. Thyroid ultrasonography and Thallium (Tl201)-technetium (Tc99m) subtraction scan showed parathyroid adenoma in the low pole of the right thyroid bed. Parathyroid aspiration cytology revealed few and discrete cells. Echocardiogram revealed moderate to severe aortic valvular calcification as well as stenosis with moderate aortic regurgitation, mitral regurgitation and myocardial calcification. The patient received parathyroidectomy one month later. During his postoperative days, he suffered from muscle twitching with positive Trousseau's sign and Chvostek's sign. The patient received calcium carbonate and vitamin D for hypocalcemia, diltiazem and capoten for his heart problems. A repeated echocardiogram two months after surgery showed no improvement of valvular calcification. This record is sourced from MEDLINE®/PubMed®, a database of the U.S. National Library of Medicine

AB  - Atomic spectrometry has been used in 20 samples of equine urinary sabulous deposits in order to detect minor elements accompanying the predominant element, calcium, which is present in the form of calcium carbonate (calcite and/or vaterite). The elements measured have been (besides calcium) magnesium, sodium, potassium, iron, copper and manganese. Phosphates, sulphates and silica are frequently present as minor constituents of equine urinary sabulous deposits and uroliths, but their detection can be difficult by infrared (IR) spectroscopy in the original samples due to overlapping with the bands of calcium carbonate. For that reason, the calcination residues of six urinary calculi and 33 samples of sabulous material have been studied by IR spectroscopy and energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis. The results confirm the presence of the above mentioned minor constituents in most samples studied. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Two cases of silicate calculi are herein reported. Case 1: A 55-year- old man visited our hospital with the chief complaint of left flank pain. X- ray examinations revealed a left ureteral stone (U 3: 8 x 5 mm). This was passed spontaneously, and its color was grayish white. Infrared spectrophotometry of the stone demonstrated that it was composed of over 98 percent silicate. The patient had been prescribed magnesium silicate as an antacid for 25 years. Case 2: A 24-year-old woman visited our hospital with the chief complaint of left lower abdominal pain. X-ray examinations revealed a left ureteral stone (U 2:7 x 5 mm). A few months later, the stone was still in the same position and her left hydronephrosis had not improved. She was therefore treated by extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL), and she then passed small pieces of grayish white stone. Infrared spectrophotometry of the stone demonstrated that it was composed of over 98 percent silicate. The patient had not taken any magnesium silicate. Twenty nine cases of silicate calculi previously reported in the Japanese literature are herein reviewed. © 2004 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam. All rights reserved.

AB  - An experimental model that allowed differentiation between endogenously and exogenously derived urinary oxalate was used to assess the effect of different forms and doses of ingested calcium on oxalate absorption and excretion. In replication 1 (R-1), subjects participated in three oxalate load (OL) tests: baseline (OL alone), calcium carbonate (OL with concomitant calcium carbonate ingestion), and calcium citrate malate (CCM) (OL with concomitant CCM ingestion). The calcium salts each provided 300 mg elemental Ca. OLs consisted of 180 mg unlabeled and 18 mg 1,2[13C<inf>2</inf>]oxalic acid. In R-2, subjects participated in four OL tests: baseline (OL alone) and OLs administered concomitantly with 100, 200, or 300 mg Ca. Timed urine samples after the OL were collected at 2-h intervals for the initial 6 h and samples were pooled into 9-h aliquots for the remaining 18 h of the 24 h period. In R-1, 24-h mean exogenous oxalate decreased (P < 0.05) after the OL from 36.2 mg (baseline) to 16.1 mg (after calcium carbonate) and to 14.3 mg (after CCM) whereas endogenous oxalate remained relatively constant. Mean 24-h oxalate absorption decreased significantly from that at the time of the baseline treatment (18.3%) after both calcium carbonate (8.1%) and CCM (7.2%) treatments. In R-2, mean 24-h oxalate absorption was significantly lower after 200 (5.9%) and 300 (7.6%) mg Ca than after 100 mg Ca (9.1%) and the OL alone (11.3%). Concomitant meal ingestion significantly decreased oxalate absorption in the absence of dietary calcium but not in association with the 300-mg Ca treatment. The overall data provide definitive evidence that dietary calcium can reduce oxalate absorption and excretion. Calcium carbonate and CCM were equally effective in this regard and a minimum of 200 mg elemental Ca maximized this effect in conjunction with an oxalic acid intake of 198 mg. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Long-time oral intake of magnesium-silicate-containing drugs is thought to be a causative factor inducing silicate urolithiasis. Besides, magnesium seems to play an anti-urolithogenic part in the formation of calcium oxalate stones. We report a recurrent calcium oxalate former who had been treated with magnesium aluminometasilicate antacid for gastric ulcer for – 17 years. One of the fragments found during extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy was identified as 100% silicate. Deposition of silica was also found on other fragments. A large dose of magnesium (given in a part of the drug) might have little influence on the formation of calcium oxalate. © 1997 S. Karger AG, Basel. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Objectives. To assess the results of jejunal conduit urinary diversion, with particular attention to electrolyte imbalance and long-term renal function. Methods. From 1976 to 1994, 50 patients underwent urinary diversion using a short jejunal loop (10 to 12 cm) placed transperitoneally. Of these patients, 18 received pelvic irradiation before diversion. Renal function and configuration of the upper urinary tract were assessed by creatinine clearance and excretory urography. Results. Median follow-up was 26 months (3 to 204). Of 50 patients, 22 had a follow-up more than 5 years later (median 86 months). Eight patients (16%) underwent 10 revision procedures postoperatively. Late complications related to urinary diversion included renal calculi (12%), parastomal hernia (6%), pyelonephritis (4%), ureterojejunal obstruction (4%), and stomal prolapse (2%). Electrolyte imbalance occurred in 2 patients (4%) and was easily corrected by 4 g sodium bicarbonate. No significant decrease in creatinine clearance (P = 0.6) was found in 22 patients with a follow-up of more than 5 years; however, of these patients, 2 had a decrease in creatinine clearance of greater than 20%, due to ureterojejunal obstruction. Of 42 ureterorenal units, hydronephrosis occurred and increased in land 2 cases, respectively, and renal scarring occurred and progressed in 2 and 2 cases, respectively. Conclusions. Urinary diversion using a short length of jejunum placed transperitoneally is a reliable procedure and gives good long-term renal function. Electrolyte imbalances are rare. Moreover, jejunal conduit can be used n almost all situations, especially after pelvic irradiation. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - During about ten years, nephrocalcin was considered the main calcium oxalate crystal growth inhibitor. Today, it appears only a urinary protein inhibitor among other ones such as non polymerized Tamm-Horsfall protein, uropontin or crystal matrix protein (CMP), a protein derived from prothrombin. All these molecules are able to inhibit either crystal growth or aggregation of calcium oxalate in urine. Another protein, named renal lithostathine, was also reported to be a potent inhibitor of secondary nucleation and growth of calcium carbonate crystals. A new urinary inhibitor of calcium oxalate formation was isolated from the urine of healthy subjects using chromatographic procedures. It is a macromolecule with a molecular weight (MW) of approximately 35 kDa as estimated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Its carbohydrate content represents an average of 8.5% of its MW. Glutamic and aspartic acids represent 24% of total amino acids. This protein is called Uronic-Acid-rich Protein (UAP) because of its uronic acid content. The same protein isolated from the urine of stone formers showed less inhibitory activity than that purified from the urine of healthy subjects. Structural modifications may explain this diminution of its inhibitory activity. This protein was also purified from rat urine using same procedures Human and rat UAP exhibit similar biochemical characteristics and strongly inhibit calcium oxalate crystallization in vitro. Partial aminoacid sequence analysis showed a homology with inter-α-trypsin inhibitor (ITI), confirmed by the immunological results on Western blot. Nevertheless, various chemical and enzymic treatments revealed that UAP and ITI are not identical molecules Consequently, urine contains several macromolecular substances belonging to ITI superfamily which are involved in the inhibition of calcium oxalate cristallization. UAP takes place among the most efficient macromolecular substances known as inhibitors in calcium oxalate nephrolithiasis. © 2004 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam. All rights reserved.

AB  - We have used published rat micro-puncture data to construct a matrix of ion concentrations along the rat nephron. With an iterative computer model of known ion interactions, we calculated relative supersaturation ratios in all nephron segments. The collecting ducts and urine showed expected supersaturation with stone-forming salts. Fluid in the thin segment of the loop of Henle may be supersaturated with calcium carbonate and calcium phosphate under certain conditions. Because calculations cannot predict the actual course of crystallization, we made solutions to mimic, in vitro, presumed conditions in the loop of Henle. The solid phases that formed were analyzed by X-ray powder diffraction, electron microprobe, and infrared spectroscopy. All samples were identified as poorly crystallized or immature apatite. The descending limb of Henle's loop creates a unique condition as it extracts water but not sodium, bicarbonate, calcium, or phosphate, giving a calcium concentration at the bend of 3 mM, pH 7.4, and a phosphate concentration that varies from 0.8 to 48 mM, depending on parathyroid hormone and dietary phosphate. We conclude that conditions in the thin segment potentially could create a solid calcium phosphate phase, which may initiate nucleation of calcium oxalate salts in the collecting ducts, potentiating nephrolithiasis and nephrocalcinosis.

AB  - We present a case of a 98-yr-old woman with acute urinary retention secondary to a large urethral calculus. This is a unique cause of obstructive uropathy for several reasons. First, urethral calculi are extremely rare in American-born Caucasian females. Second, urethral stones in females are nearly always associated with underlying genitourinary pathology; however, subsequent work up failed to reveal any strictures, diverticula, or related processes that may have predisposed this patient to urethral calculus formation. The epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical presentation, and emergency management of large urethral calculi are reviewed. © 2007 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.; Medline is the source for the MeSH terms of this document.

AB  - Urinary stones are being recognized more frequently in children. As a result of major advancements in the urological therapies available to children with obstructed uropathy, infection-related stones no longer dominate the clinical manifestations of pediatric urolithiasis. Clinical manifestations of urolithiasis in children differ somewhat from adults and change during childhood. Causes of urolithiasis in children are remarkably similar to those of adults, although diagnostic criteria frequently vary throughout childhood. Hypercalciuria is the most common metabolic cause of pediatric urolithiasis. This article presents a general overview of urolithiasis in children and a practical approach to the medical evaluation of such children. © 2007 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.; Medline is the source for the MeSH terms of this document.

AB  - Calcium stones arise from imbalances between urinary excretions of insoluble salts and water. Idiopathic hypercalciuria and hyperparathyroidism are the calcium disorders usually associated with elevated levels of calcium in the urine. Renal tubular acidosis is associated with a disordered acid- base status that results in low urine citrate. Hypocitraturia itself is a cause of calcium stones because it leaves urine calcium free to complex with either oxalate or phosphate. Elevated urine oxalate is commonly associated with dietary excesses, bowel disease, and, rarely, primary hyperoxaluria. Hyperuricosuria, usually of dietary origin, when reversed can cause a fall in new calcium stones. © 2007 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.; Medline is the source for the MeSH terms of this document.

AB  - It has been suggested that citrate salts might enhance aluminum (Al) absorption from a normal diet, posing a threat of Al toxicity even in subjects with normal renal function. We have recently reported that in normal subjects and patients with moderate renal failure, short-term treatment with tricalcium dicitrate (Ca3Cit2) does not significantly change urinary and serum Al levels. However, we have not assessed total body Al stores in patients on long-term citrate treatment. The objective of this study was to ascertain body content of Al non-invasively using the increment in serum and urinary Al following the intravenous administration of deferoxamine (DFO) in patients with kidney stones and osteoporotic women undergoing long-term treatment with potassium citrate (K3Cit) or Ca3Cit2, respectively. Ten patients with calcium nephrolithiasis and five with osteoporosis who were maintained on potassium citrate (40 mEq/day or more) or calcium citrate 800 mg calcium/day (40 mEq citrate) for 2 to 8 years, respectively, and 16 normal volunteers without a history of regular aluminum-containing antacid use participated in the study. All participants completed the 8 days of study, during which they were maintained on their regular home diet. Urinary Al excretion was measured during a two-day baseline before (Days 5, 6) and for 1 day (Day 7) immediately following a single intravenous dose of DFO (40 mg/kg). Blood for Al was obtained before DFO administration, and at 2, 5 and 24 hours following the start of the infusion. The median 24-hour urinary Al excretion (microgram/day) at baseline versus post-DFO value was 15.9 vs. 44.4 in the normal subjects and 13.3 vs. 35.7 in the patients. These values were all within normal limits and did not change significantly following DFO infusion (p = 0.003 and p = 0.0001, respectively). The median change of 17.1 micrograms/day in urinary Al in the normal subjects was not significantly different from the 18.7 micrograms/day change measured in the patient group (p = 0.30). Similarly, no change in the mean serum Al was detected at any time following the DFO infusion, either in the patient or control group (patients 4.1 to 4.3 ng/ml, controls 7.4 to 4.6 ng/ml). The results suggest that abnormal total body retention of Al does not occur during long-term citrate treatment in patients with functioning kidneys. © 1996 American College of Nutrition. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - A large proportion of urinary stones have calcium oxalate (CaOx) as the major mineral phase. In these stones, CaOx is generally associated with minor amounts of other calcium salts. Several reports showing the presence of calcium carbonate (CaCO <inf>3</inf> ) and calcium phosphate in renal stones suggested that crystals of those salts might be present in the early steps of stone formation. Such crystals might therefore promote CaOx crystallization from supersaturated urine by providing an appropriate substrate for heterogeneous nucleation. That possibility was investigated by seeding a metastable solution of 45 Ca oxalate with vaterite or calcite crystallites. Accretion of CaOx was monitored by 45 Ca incorporation. We showed that (1) seeds of vaterite (the hexagonal polymorph of CaCO <inf>3</inf> ) and calcite (the rhomboedric form) could initiate calcium oxalate crystal growth; (2) in the presence of lithostathine, an inhibitor of CaCO <inf>3</inf> crystal growth, such accretion was not observed. In addition, scanning electron microscopy demonstrated that growth occurred by epitaxy onto calcite seeds whereas no special orientation was observed onto vaterite. It was concluded that calcium carbonate crystals promote crystallization of calcium oxalate and that inhibitors controlling calcium carbonate crystal formation in Henle's loop might play an important role in the prevention of calcium oxalate stone formation. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The secondary constituents accompanying calcite and vaterite (crystalline forms of calcium carbonate) in the sabulous deposits from 140 vesical samples and one renal sample of equine urine were studied by infrared spectroscopy (IR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX). Apatitic calcium phosphate, present in 12 per cent of the samples, generally appeared in the form of spherulites with smooth and rough surfaces. Calcium sulphate, clearly detected by IR in 12·7 per cent of the samples, did not have a characteristic structure under SEM. although EDX detected sulphur in the samples. Amorphous silica was observed in one case and had a nodular appearance. Organic fibres were not as common as might have been expected in equine urinary deposits. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The effect of citrate on calcium oxalate (CaOx) crystal growth was studied in a system in which series of samples containing [45Ca]calcium chloride were brought to different levels of supersaturation with various concentrations of oxalate. The crystallization was assessed by measuring the amount of isotope remaining in solution 30 min after the addition of CaOx seed crystals to samples containing citrate in concentrations corresponding to those in final urine. The experiments were carried out both in pure salt solutions and in solutions with dialysed urine. Increased concentrations of citrate resulted in a reduced crystallization of CaOx in both the presence and absence of dialysed urine, but with the lowest rate of crystallization in the samples containing urine. The increased concentration of 45Ca remaining in solution reflected a reduced crystallization, which could possibly be explained both by a reduced supersaturation and by an increased inhibition of CaOx crystal growth. The direct effects of citrate on CaOx crystal growth were assessed by calculating the ion-activity product of CaOx (AP<inf>CaOx</inf>) at corresponding degrees of crystallization. The AP<inf>CaOx</inf> recorded at a 30% reduction of the amount of isotope in solution increased with increasing concentrations of citrate between 1.0 and 1.5 mmol/1 in samples both with and without dialysed urine. These findings indicate that citrate has a weak direct inhibitory effect on CaOx crystal growth, which adds to the reduced growth rate brought about by urinary macromolecules and a decreased supersaturation. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Indigestion, after headache, is the ailment most likely to be treated with a nonprescription medicine. In 1994, sales of indigestion remedies increased by 11.7 per cent in volume terms (16.1 per cent by value), some of which was due to the POM to P switch of H<inf>2</inf>-receptor antagonists. P products account for only 8.5 per cent of total indigestion remedy sales. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The knowledge of the chemical-physical nature of urinary stones can be useful in the epidemiological evaluation of this disease: advantages may be obtained using special therapeutic and prophylactic approaches. Our experience using a Fourier Transform spectrophotometric laser has underlined the advantages of laser spectrophotometry in the qualitative and quantitative analysis of urinary calculi. In our daily experience it has been shown to be a simple and useful device in a urological department and it has allowed us to avoid the use of external laboratories and to reduce the times of response and examination costs. Consequently it has increased the number of calculi examined. Using stone differentiated preparation techniques based on the size of the single stone, since February 1994 we have studied 200 urinary stones, identifying their components. The method and the results are presented. © 2004 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam. All rights reserved.

AB  - The Urolithiasis is a universal problem since antiquity but It's etiology is still an enigma. Our earlier community based study revealed high incidence of urolithiasis (7.6%), which prompted us to undertake the present study with aim to understand the aetiopathogenesis of urolithiasis in Satpura mountain range. The calculi from 170 adult patients operated in College Hospital, Dhule over three year period were clinico-biochemicaly analysed. The maximum cases were in males, in reproductive age group 21-40 years (66.5%). The calculi were composed of calcium phosphate (65.7%), calcium oxalate (32.1%). Triple phosphate (1.2%) and calcium carbonate. Thus present study highlights pattern of urolithiasis in Satpura region of Maharastra. © 2004 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam. All rights reserved.

AB  - The effects of calcium gluconate on the utilization of magnesium and nephrocalcinosis in male Wistar rats made magnesium-deficient by adding excess dietary phosphorus (1.195 g of phosphorus/100 g of diet) and calcium (1.04 g of calcium/100 g of diet) were compared with the effects of calcium carbonate. The effects of dietary magnesium concentration on the magnesium status and nephrocalcinosis were also examined. Adding excess dietary phosphorus and calcium decreased the apparent magnesium absorption ratios and the concentrations of magnesium in the serum and femur and increased the deposition of calcium in the kidney, and the low magnesium condition (0.024 g of magnesium/100 g of diet) aggravated the deposition of calcium and the low magnesium status. The apparent magnesium absorption ratios and femur magnesium concentration in the rats fed a calcium gluconate diet (an equimolar mixture of calcium gluconate and calcium carbonate was used as a source of calcium) were significantly higher than in the rats fed a calcium carbonate diet (only calcium carbonate was used as a source of calcium), irrespective of dietary magnesium concentration. Dietary calcium gluconate lessened the accumulation of calcium in the kidney and increased the serum magnesium concentration compared with dietary calcium carbonate, when the rats were fed the normal magnesium diet (0.049 g of magnesium/100 g of diet) but not the low magnesium diet. We speculate that the increased utilization of magnesium by feeding the calcium gluconate diet to a limited extent prevented the low magnesium status and the severity of nephrocalcinosis caused by adding excess dietary phosphorus and calcium. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - History and clinical findings: A 54-year-old man was hospitalised because hypercalcaemia and associated renal failure were suspected. He had a history suggesting gastric ulcer, with nonspecific back and shoulder pain and spontaneously passed kidney stone. On admission the patient reported reduction in physical fitness, fatigue, headache and nausea without vomiting. Physical examination was unremarkable except for pain on pressure over the thoracic and lumbar vertebrae. Investigations: Hypercalcaemia of 3.9 mmol/l was found while parathormone was low. Serum creatinine concentration was 2.8 mg/dl. Malignancy was excluded after extensive tests. A florid gastric ulcer was demonstrated, together with Helicobacter pylori infection. Computed tomography revealed stippled calcifications in the kidneys. Treatment and course: Renal function markedly improved, the hypercalcaemia disappeared and the parathormone level rose within four days of the adminstration of sodium chloride (2.5 l daily of a 0.9% solution) and of furosemide (40 mg daily). Repeat questioning of the patient revealed that because of stomach pains he had for four years been taking up to 6 g calcium carbonate daily in the form of a prescription-free antacid. He was thereupon treated for a milk-alkali syndrome. Calcium concentration became normal, while renal function has remained slightly impaired a year later. The ulcer has healed without recurrence on eradication of the Helicobacter pylori infection with amoxicillin and omeprazole. Conclusions: The danger of some 'over the counter' prescription-free medications should not be underestimated and patients should be routinely questioned about them. Absorbable antacids should no longer be taken in the treatment of peptic complaints now that effective antacids, H<inf>2</inf>-receptor antagonists and proton-pump inhibitors have become available. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The formation of urinary stones is relatively common. They may contain uric acid, struvite or cystine, but they are most frequently formed from calcium oxalate. Patients who have stones which result in symptoms should have urine microscopy, renal function tests and imaging of the urinary tract. Although surgical treatment may be required, the role of diet and increased fluid intake should not be overlooked. Up to half the patients will develop recurrent stones. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The composition and crystal morphology of 141 equine sabulous deposits were determined by infrared spectroscopy (IR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX). The IR analysis revealed that all investigated deposits contained calcium carbonates (calcite, CaCO<inf>3</inf>, and/or vaterite, CaCO<inf>3</inf>) as major constituents; 42 samples were composed of calcite and vaterite, 33 of calcite, 18 of calcite/vaterite and calcium oxalate, and 17 of vaterite. The remaining specimens contained calcite/vaterite and other compounds (calcium phosphates, sulphate and/or oxalates and/or silica). The examination of 44 selected samples by means of SEM/EDX, revealed the characteristic morphology and elemental composition of the constituents of the sabulous deposits. Calcite crystals showed a typical spherical shape, as well as other less common rhombohedral habit. Vaterite displayed a 'flower' or 'star' appearance and also a 'mulberry' shape. Less frequent was a spherular habit for vaterite resembling that of calcite. Elemental analysis of both calcite and vaterite crystals showed, besides calcium, varying proportions of magnesium and potassium. It is concluded that calcite and vaterite were mainly present in a substituted form. Calcium oxalate dihydrate crystals showed their characteristic bipyramidal morphology. Calcium oxalate monohydrate crystals, which were less frequent, exhibited 'dumbbell' or 'hour-glass' shape. © 2007 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.; Medline is the source for the MeSH terms of this document.

AB  - The identification of a universal stone model standard would enable reproducible fragmentation data useful for the design, evaluation, and comparison of various lithotripsy devices. The clinical benefits of such a stone model include the elucidation of setting parameters that would optimize fragmentation strategies. Iceland spar is a pure form of calcite (CaCO<inf>3</inf>) that was subjected to experimental disintegration by electrohydraulic lithotripsy and extracorporeal Shockwave lithotripsy. Iceland spar was fragmented with both lithotripsy methods in a reproducible fashion. The degree of fragmentation was directly related to alterations in either power or shock frequency. Iceland spar is radiopaque, inexpensive, easily obtained, homogenous in composition, and sizable. Iceland spar meets a variety of stone model criteria, warranting its continued investigation as a potential stone model standard. © 1995, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

AB  - The formation of urinary calculi following renal transplantation is a rare event with a frequency of less than 1% (4). Although 133 cases were described up to 1988, only 5 of these had pure uric acid stones (3). We report a case in which an excessive purine-rich diet probably caused the stone formation. Three modalities of treatment were used, percutaneous nephrolithotripsy, shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) and chemolysis. © 1995 Informa UK Ltd. © 2014 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Eight patients (6 women and 2 men) with osteoporosis caused or aggravated by renal acidification defects are presented. Three of the female patients were premenopausal; the others were 9, 20 and 22 years postmenopausal, and two of them were on hormonal replacement therapy. Two patients had nephrolithiasis: one male with recurrent calcium phosphate stones and a left sided staghorn calculus, and one female with nephrocalcinosis due to medullary sponge kidney and hypercalciuria (patients No 1 and 2, respectively, Table 1). In the remaining subjects, clinical suspicion was based on: a) Hip fracture in a 44-yr-old premenopausal female without any risk factor (No 3, Table 2). b) Several vertebral compression fractures in a 45-yr-old male without hypogonadism or other predisposing factors (No 7, Table 2). c) Lack of response to antiosteoporotic therapy in 3 women (patients No 4, 6 and 8, Table 2). Serum bicarbonate levels and urine acidification capacity were studied in all patients. Three had low serum bicarbonate (two of whom showed high fractional excretion of bicarbonate), four had a distal defect, and one had a mixed form. Serum creatinine and potassium, and venous blood pH were normal in all cases, suggesting incomplete renal tubular acidosis. Bone mineral density in Z-score (x ± s.e.m.) was - 1.75 ± 0.08 in the lumbar spine (n = 8), and 1.57 ± 0.09 in the femoral neck (n = 4). Following one year treatment with oral sodium bicarbonate and potassium citrate, total skeletal calcium increased by 3-10% in five of the patients. Whereas the high prevalence of renal acidification defects among renal stone formers with or without hypercalciuria is well acknowledged, renal tubular acidosis is not included in the list of entities causing secondary osteoporosis. As shown in 6 patients of this series, incomplete RTA should be considered as another disease capable of causing osteoporosis or worsening involutional bone loss. © 2004 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.; Medline is the source for the MeSH terms of this document.

AB  - We determined the clinical efficacy of captopril for the prevention of new stones or stone growth in patients with homozygous cystinuria. Nine patients with a history of multiple cystine stones despite standard fluid and alkalization therapy received 50 mg. captopril, 3 times daily in addition to the standard therapy. Before treatment the rate of new stone formation or stone growth ranged from 0.7 to 2.0 events (mean 1.2) per patient-year for 1 to 3 years of observation (mean 1.9). During treatment the rate ranged from 0 to 3.0 events (mean 1.03) per patient-year for 0.5 to 6 years (mean 2.9). Although statistical significance was not evident for the group as a whole (p = 0.35), our findings suggest that captopril may be clinically efficacious in at least some patients with difficult to control cystinuria. Recommendations regarding its indications in this setting are made. © 1995 American Urological Association, Inc. © 2014 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Abnormalities of Ca metabolism in hypertension may involve anomalies in the regulation of extracellular Ca as modulated by PTH, vitamin D, and the renin-angiotensin systems. Under specific physiological conditions, such as pregnancy-induced hypertension where the abnormality is clearly characterized by hypocalciuria and large increases of intracellular free Ca, the impact of Ca intervention can be demonstrated. Observational studies of large populations support the possibility that Ca intake has an impact on blood pressure. This potential is further supported by data from intervention studies in animal models. However, contradictions persist in Ca intervention studies of human hypertensives. The results of these studies have been inconsistent and for the most part negative, with exception of intervention in preeclampsia. PIH and preeclampsia share a common denominator with experimental hypertension, namely the development of hypertension in a short period of time. There is not enough evidence at present to support the view that Ca deficiency causes hypertension, yet it may be involved in the exacerbation of hypertension associated with Na sensitivity. It appears that populations consuming ≥RDA of Ca (800 mg Ca/day for males and females > 25 years and 1200 mg Ca/day for pregnant females) have a lower incidence of Na sensitivity and a lower prevalence of PIH. Perhaps the population with the highest chance for positive effect is blacks who have been shown in some reports to have diets low in Ca (below the RDA in most investigations) and high in Na. Given the totality of available data, there are still significant critical gaps in knowledge. Despite accumulating evidence, there is no clear- cut conceptualization of how dietary Ca may affect blood pressure. One plausible hypothesis is through an impact on the free intracellular Ca ion, a well-documented and significant determinant of blood pressure regulation. However, while it may be logical to presume a relationship between intake and concentrations of intracellular Ca, this association has not been rigorously examined or documented. The relevance of increased urinary Ca to either dietary intake or subsequent changes in blood pressure has to be assessed further. In particular, the apparent anomalies that have been attributed to hypertension have to be closely examined in order to determine if they are a primary or secondary consequence or are etiologically related to the disorder. Irrespective of the population studied, body weight reduction has been the single, most consistent non-pharmacological method of controlling blood pressure. Interventions with any other component must not lose sight of this preventive approach. Further research is needed into the interaction of factors positively influencing blood pressure, such as Na, body weight, and alcohol, with those that are putatively beneficial, including Ca, K, and Mg. The impact of chronic dietary patterns on long-term blood pressure regulation and the etiology of hypertension, as well as the therapeutic potential for blood pressure regulation, also have to be further assessed. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Persistent residual stone fragments after extracorporeal Shockwave lithotripsy (ESWL), percutaneous nephrolitholapaxy (PNL) as well as pyelo- and nephrolithotomy represent a great problem in the treatment of stones. The choice of therapy for patients with insufficient renal drainage, poor renal function, and a high anesthetic risk also remains quite difficult. Between 1991 and 1993, 5 patients underwent percutaneous antegrading chemolysis with ‘Suby G’ solution. Two patients, presenting struvite and apatite stones, were free of stones afterwards. In 1 patient, where stone analysis revealed a predominant brushite component, a large decrease in stone size could be observed. In 2 other cases, with stones mainly consisting of whewellite and weddelite, chemolysis proved ineffective. Evaluating our own clinical experience and relevant medical literature, the present study goes on to prove that the indication of percutaneous chemolysis in risk patients as described above is dependent on stone analysis, and must be regarded as an effective adjuvant treatment. © 1995 S.

AB  - The aim of the study was to compare the renal citrate excretion and the degree of urine saturation with calcium oxalate in patients with active calcium oxalate urolithiasis and in healthy subjects under basal conditions and after alkalization. There were 20 women before menopause with calcium stone disease aged 33.5 +/- 7.1 in the first group and 20 healthy women aged 32.3 +/- 7.6 in the second one. Sodium bicarbonate was administrated intravenously in a dose 16.8 g during 2 h. 24h excretion of calcium, magnesium and citrate, the degree of urine saturation with calcium oxalate and pH of urine before and after alkalization were evaluated. Hypocitraturia occurred in 45% of patients under basal conditions. The degree of urine saturation with calcium oxalate was significantly higher in women with nephrolithiasis (p < 0.01). A significant increase of citrate excretion (p < 0.001) and a decrease of calcium excretion (p < 0.05) after alkalization took place in both groups. The degree of urine saturation with calcium oxalate decreased significantly in patients with urolithiasis and in healthy subjects. During acute alkalosis, induced by sodium bicarbonate, increase of citrate excretion was observed in patients with urolithiasis in spite of hypocitraturia under basal conditions. This indicates that kidney function following alkalization is normal in "stone kidney". Significantly decreased saturation of urine with calcium oxalate was due to the decrease of calcium excretion and the increase of citrate excretion. In conclusion, the results show that the use of alkalizing factors in prevention of recurrent calcium urolithiasis is justifiable.

AB  - ESWL and PCN have modified the urinary stones therapy. Nevertheless these therapeutic procedures are not much effective in cystine stone because of its protein structure and frequent recurrences; these procedures need to be combined to achieve the best results. In cystine stones the lithochemolysis, performed following recent technique has shown excellent results, without complications and easy to apply.

AB  - Urinary calculi from 17 horses with urolithiasis were examined to study their mineral content and ultrastructure. Among the analytic methods used were X-ray diffractometry, scanning electron microscopy, and electron microprobe analysis. The calculi initially were observed by use of a stereoscopic dissecting microscope and generally were found to have nodular surfaces surrounding a banded or granular-to-chalky interior. Observation by scanning electron microscopy revealed an intricate pattern of irregularly concentric, fine bands and spherules. These had a round, finely banded, globular texture formed by precipitation of ultrafine-grained radiating crystals. The original pore spaces (ie, between spherules, between bands and spherules, or between crystal generations) could be observed as primary porosity. Precipitation and dissolution of these urinary calculi were observed to be spontaneous processes, which can occur simultaneously within an individual calculus. Another prominent feature of the ultrastructure was secondary porosity (spontaneous dissolution) which, in its incipient stages, appeared to be site-selective (ie, some bands appeared to be more susceptible to development of pinpoint porosity). Textures indicative of dissolution were observed not only on the calculus surface, but within the calculus interior as well. Areas that had more advanced stages of dissolution, resulting in increased secondary porosity, also were observed. All 17 samples of the study were found to be composed of calcium carbonate in the form of the mineral calcite, although minor quantities of 2 other polymorphs of calcium carbonate, minerals vaterite and aragonite, also were encountered. Vaterite was observed in 5 of the samples, whereas aragonite was found in 1 sample. Strontium and sulfur were observed as trace elements in 3 of the calculi, whereas magnesium was present in all calculi. Magnesium was observed to substitute for calcium within the calcite crystal lattice in larger quantities than those of strontium or sulfur. Magnesium K alpha X-ray dot maps generated by use of an electron microprobe analyzer indicated that the distribution pattern of magnesium appeared to closely follow layer-by-layer growth of the calculus. Magnesium distribution also appeared to be related to porosity development. In samples where preferential dissolution was observed, the more porous areas had higher magnesium content. Quantitative chemical analyses, using the electron microprobe analyzer, confirmed these observations. Association of the magnesium distribution pattern to the primary growth texture of the calculus indicated that magnesium content of the calculus varied during the formation process. This also indicated that changes in urine chemical analytes may be reflected in composition of the calculi formed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS) This record is sourced from MEDLINE®/PubMed®, a database of the U.S. National Library of Medicine

AB  - In a 4x4-wk cross-over study, eight adult cats were given four moist diets containing identical amounts of calcium (13.9 mmol/MJ) but with different ratios of calcium carbonate to calcium chloride, the calcium salts providing half of the total dietary calcium. Increasing amounts of calcium chloride were substituted for equimolar amounts of calcium carbonate. Higher intakes of calcium chloride caused significantly lower pH values in postprandial and 24-h urine samples. The urinary excretion of ammonium and titratable acid rose with increasing calcium chloride intake. The urinary concentrations of calcium and magnesium were not affected by the type of calcium salt, but the urinary excretion and concentration of phosphorus were significantly depressed when the amount of calcium chloride in the diet was increased. The results are discussed in the context of dietary prevention of and therapy for struvite urolithiasis in cats.

AB  - The serum and 24 hour urinary excretion levels of various lithogenic and inhibitory substances were assessed in 24 male patients with calcium stone and no previous history of urolithiasis and in 19 age-matched controls. Two groups did not differ significantly (P < 0.01) except in the excretions of sodium, citric acid (being higher in normals) and inorganic phosphate (being higher in patients). Fifty percent patients had hyperphosphaturia, 29.2% hypocitraturia, 20.8% hyperoxaluria and 16.7% hypercalciuria. The present data suggests that hypocitraturia in association with phosphaturia might be one of the main risk factors responsible for calcium urolithiasis in this area.

AB  - Recent studies have suggested that defective medullary trapping of ammonia underlies the acidosis associated with renal failure and sets in motion maladaptive compensatory mechanisms that contribute to the progression of renal disease. Since a renal concentrating defect is an early functional abnormality in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), defective medullary trapping and urinary excretion of ammonia may also occur early and have important pathophysiological consequences. The urinary pH and excretions of ammonia, titratable acid, and bicarbonate, were measured during a 24-hour baseline period and following the administration of ammonium chloride (100 mg/kg body wt) in ADPKD patients with normal glomerular filtration rate and in age- and gender-matched healthy control subjects. The distal nephron hydrogen ion secretory capacity was assessed during a bicarbonate infusion. Ammonia, sodium, pH, C3dg, and C5b-9 were measured in cyst fluid samples. The excretion rates of ammonia during the 24-hour baseline period and following the administration of ammonium chloride were significantly lower, and the relationship of ammonia excretion to urinary pH was significantly shifted downward in ADPKD. No difference in the increment of urinary pCO<inf>2</inf> (Δ pCO<inf>2</inf>) or the peripheral blood-urine pCO<inf>2</inf> gradient (U- B pCO<inf>2</inf>) between ADPKD patients and control subjects was detected during a sodium bicarbonate infusion. Calculated concentrations of free-base ammonia in cyst fluid samples exceeded those calculated from reported concentrations of ammonia in renal venous blood of normal subjects. C3dg and C5b-9 were detected in some cyst fluids. The urinary excretion of ammonia is reduced in ADPKD patients with normal glomerular filtration rate. This reduction is not explained by a lower production of ammonia in the renal cortex or by a defect of proton secretion in the collecting ducts. It is likely due to an impaired renal concentrating mechanism and reduced trapping of ammonia in the renal medulla. It may contribute to the pathogenesis of nephrolithiasis and, more importantly, to the progression of the interstitial inflammation and cystic changes seen in ADPKD. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Urinary acidification ability, acid-base status and urinary excretion of calcium and citrate were evaluated in 10 women with bilateral medullary sponge kidney (MSK) and in 10 healthy women. Patients with MSK had higher fasting urine pH compared to normal controls (p < 0.01). Four patients had incomplete renal tubular acidiosis (iRTA), 3 had hypercalciuria, and 5 patients had hypocitraturia. The 24-hour urinary excretion of calcium was increaed in the females with MSK (5.23 ± 0.78 mmol) compared to the healthy females (3.49 ± 0.29 mmol) (p < 0.02), and increased in MSK patients with iRTA (7.32 ± 1.45 mmol) compared to patients with normal urinary acidification (3.83 ± 0.12 mmol) (p ‹ 0.01). The patients with iRTA had reduced levels of plasma standard bicarbonate (20.5 ± 1.0) after fasting compared to patients with normal urinary acidification (23.8 ± 0.8) and healthy women (22.7 ± 0.6) (p ‹ 0.01), and reduced levels of 24-hour urinary excretion of citrate (0.93 ± 0. 25 mmol) compared to patients with normal urinary acidification (3.58 ± 0.51) and healthy women (2.78 ± 0.49) (p <0.005). A positive correlation was found between the degree of acidosis during ammonium chloride loading and urinary excretion of calcium (r = 0.71, p = 0.02), and a negative correlation between the degree of acidosis during ammonium chloride loading and urinary citrate excretion (r = 0.87, p = 0.001). The results suggest that defective urinary acidification might play an important role in the mechanism of hypercalciuria and hypocitraturia in patients with medullary sponge kidney. Furthermore, our data suggest that in the group of patients with bilateral MSK there might be two categories. In one category, iRTA is present. The main metabolic lithogenic factors in this group appear to be increased urinary excretion of calcium, decreased urinary excretion of citrate and increased urine pH. The other category does not have iRTA, and the metabolic abnormalities related to stone disease are much less pronounced. © 1994 S. Karger AG, Basel. © 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Objectives.: The value of repeated analyses of 24-hour urine collectionsfor daily excretion of calcium, uric acid, citrate, phosphorus, and creatinine and for volume and pH performed to detect and classify metabolic disorders in a selected group of calcium stone formers with striking recurrence rates was assessed in a retrospective study. Methods.: A total of 441 urinalyses made over a mean period of 80.4 months of samples obtained from 49 patients were reviewed. Fifty-nine percent of patients were initially found to have metabolic disorders (absorptive hypercalciuria types I and II, hyperuricuria, hypocitraturia) and therefore received specific drug therapy (allopurinol, thiazide, alkali citrate, orthophosphate) for a mean of 45.7 months (group I). The remaining patients were classified as metabolically inactive and were given general metaphylactic instructions (group II). Results.: In 73% of patients recurrent stones developed, with no statistically significantdifference between the two groups (79% vs 65%). In 55% of group I patients, urinalyses continued to yield abnormal findings during follow-up; however, subsequent abnormal findings were also seen in 40% of the metabolically inactive group II patients. Overall, metabolic disorders were observed at some point in 75% of patients. Only 27% remained recurrence free, and 62% thereof also had pathologic urinary findings. Conclusions.: It does not appear that drug treatment in recurrent calcium urolithiasisbased on urinary findings is superior to simple general metaphylactic recommendations, nor that repeated analyses of 24-hour urine collections furnish additional information on the risk of recurrent stone formation or on the presence of risk factors leading to recurrence in the long-term course of disease. © 1994. © 2014 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The effect of dietary calcium level on the fecal and urinary excretion of calcium, phosphorus and magnesium was studied in adult cats. Ovariectomized cats were fed purified diets containing 3.2, 4.8, 9.5 or 19.3 mmol calcium/MJ in a 4 x 4 wk crossover study. During the experiment, balance studies were performed and blood samples were taken. The adult ovariectomized cats maintained calcium balance at all four levels of calcium tested. Extra dietary calcium, in the form of CaCO<inf>3</inf>, caused a slight increase in urinary pH. Urinary concentrations of phosphorus and magnesium dropped, but that of calcium remained unchanged, when the cats were fed diets with increasing calcium levels. The percentages of apparent absorption of phosphorus and magnesium fell when calcium intake was raised. The dietary calcium level did not affect plasma concentrations of calcium, magnesium and phosphorus or plasma activity of alkaline phosphatase. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - There are more than a dozen commonly prescribed calcium supplements and hundreds of different formulations commercially available. Numerous factors need to be considered when selecting a calcium preparation. Physical properties such as solubility, interference from coingested medications or foodstuffs, dosage, and timing can all affect the bioavailability of calcium. Medical conditions such as lactose intolerance, impaired gastric acid secretion, and high risk profile for kidney stone formation may impact on selection of a calcium supplement. This article will review the available literature and make general recommendations for the optimal use of calcium preparations. © 1994 International Life Sciences Institute © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The first case was a 53-year-old female with the chief complaint of gross hematuria. She had multiple uric acid calculi which were 5 to 15 mm in size in the right kidney. The patient was given uralyt-u® and allopurinol. A CT scan given on the 17th day after the treatment demonstrated the disappearance of the calculi. The second case was a 73-year-old man who complained of gross hematuria. Under the diagnosis of uric acid calculi which occupied the left renal pelvis, we commenced administration of sodium bicarbonate with allopurinol. CT scan 18 months after the start of oral administration revealed the dissolution of the calculus. Alkalization of the urine proved to be very effective for the dissolution of uric acid calculi. © 2004 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Two cases of silicate calculi are reported. Case 1: A 41-year-old male who complained of dull, right-flank pain was diagnosed as having a right ureteral stone. Spontaneous passage of the calculi occurred. Infrared spectrophotometry of the stone demonstrated silicate. The patient had a past history of pancreatitis, and had been administered magnesium silicate as an anti-acid drug for a period of six years. Case 2: A 38-year-old male who complained of right-flank colicky pain was diagnosed as having a right ureteral stone. Infrared spectrophotometry of the stone which was passed spontaneously revealed silicate, however this patient had not been taking magnesium silicate medication. 28 cases of silicate calculi previously reported in the Japanese literature are reviewed. © 2004 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - We studied six patients with renal stone disease, hypercalciuria, cystinuria and/or hyperuricosuria, during variations in dietary Na and Cl intake. Switching between equimolar NaCl and NaHCO<inf>3</inf> intakes reduced urinary Ca (UCa) during the NaHCO<inf>3</inf> phase, despite steady-state urinary Na. Switching between equimolar NaCl and KCl did not change UCa, despite a sharp fall in UNa. The results suggest a predominant role for Cl rather than Na ions during sodium-chloride-induced changes in UCa. In stone disease of mixed aetiology, where alkalinization of the urine as well as reduction in UCa may be desirable, treatment with NaHCO<inf>3</inf> loading is not accompanied by a rise in UCa, provided that dietary Cl is maintained moderately low at 80–100 mmol/day. The mechanism whereby Cl intake influences UCa remains undefined. Plasma PTH and calcitriol levels showed no significant alteration, and atrial natriuretic peptide levels in one patient remained unchanged. © 1994 Oxford University Press. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Thirty‐six Australian Aboriginal children with urolithiasis were reviewed. Males dominated the series. The age distribution ranged from 8 months to 12 years and nearly 70% were 2 years or younger. Thirty‐five patients had upper tract stones. Ultrasound was diagnostic in 35 patients and was falsely negative in one. Dietary factors, dehydration and recurrent diarrhoea are incriminated in the aetiology, because ammonium urate and oxalate were the main constituents of the stones. Malformations of the urinary tract were rare and known metabolic disorders were not seen. Chemical dissolution of the stones was found to be a safe and effective adjuvant in the management of urate stones. Copyright © 1994, Wiley Blackwell.

AB  - Lithostathine is a protein of pancreatic secretion inhibiting calcium carbonate crystal growth. Antibodies to lithostathine were used to identify a related protein in urine and kidney stones. Western blot analysis of proteins extracted from concentrated normal urine or kidney stones demonstrated the presence of a protein with an apparent molecular weight of 23 kDa. The same antibodies were used in immunolocalization experiments on fresh human nephrectomy specimens cryosections. A positive signal was observed in the cells of proximal tubules and thick ascending limbs of Henle's loop. Protein extracts of renal stones inhibited calcium carbonate crystal growth. Because of its structural and functional similarities with pancreatic lithostathine, it was called renal lithostathine. © 2004 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The current knowledge concerning macromolecular inhibitors of crystallization in saliva and in bile are reviewed. In saliva, four families of inhibiting proteins have been evidenced: the statherins, the acidic proline-rich proteins, the cystatins and the histatins. These proteins inhibit the nucleation and the growth of calcium phosphate salts. In the bile, two families of proteins that inhibit the nucleation of calcium carbonate and cholesterol are present: the apolipoproteins and the calcium binding protein also called anionic polypeptide fraction. The structure-function relationships of these molecules are particularly stressed. © 2004 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Drug-induced urinary calculi are rarely observed. However, it is useful to know this etiology. A complete anamnesis of drugs and dosages is mandatory if a patient presents with lithiasis, since some pharmacotherapies may carry an enhanced lithogenic risk. The list of lithogenic drugs is discussed. In order to yield preventive data, infrared spectrophotometry is the best available analytic method. © 2011 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Two sets of animal experiments using guinea pigs were planned to evaluate the effect of ascorbic acid supplementation on the lithogenic process. In the first set of experiments, 10, 40, and 60 mg doses of ascorbic acid/100g body weight/day were given for 105 days. Neither of the ascorbic acid doses given induced crystalluria, calcification or stone formation, thereby confirming our previous findings that ascorbic acid in the doses used by clinicians does not cause urolith formation. In the second set of experiments, ascorbic acid was supplemented in hypercalciuric (induced by calcium carbonate feeding) and hyperoxaluric (induced by sodium oxalate feeding) animals for 45 days. The results indicated that it exacerbated the calcification process in renal and bladder tissue.; Two sets of animal experiments using guinea pigs were planned to evaluate the effect of ascorbic acid supplementation on the lithogenic process.

AB  - The hypothesis that mild hyperoxaluria is more important than hypercalciuria in the pathogenesis of urolithiasis is re-examined in the light of new evidence. Small increments in urinary oxalate in the normal to high-normal range are much more critical than similar rises in urinary calcium for increasing the relative supersaturation of urine with respect to calcium oxalate, the oxalate/calcium ratio in urine, the total volume of calcium oxalate crystals excreted, the proportion of abnormally large crystals and aggregates of calcium oxalate and the severity of the disorder as defined by the recurrence rate of stone-formation. Data from the Arabian Peninsula, where the prevalence of calcium-containing stones is considerably higher than in the West, have shown that this occurs in spite of the almost complete absence of hypercalciuria. On the other hand, there is a strong association between stone-formation and the occurrence of mild hyperoxaluria. The lifetime expectancy of stone-formation in men from various countries is strongly correlated with the average daily excretion of oxalate in the urine of the normal men in these countries. This relationship extends to include patients with enteric and hereditary hyperoxaluria. There is no such relationship, however, between the life-time expectancy of stones and urinary calcium excretion in the same populations. Studies on the regulation of urinary oxalate indicate that it is largely controlled by the quantity of 'free' dietary oxalate available for absorption in the lower intestine. This can be calculated from the intakes of calcium and oxalate and the urinary excretion of calcium.; The hypothesis that mild hyperoxaluria is more important than hypercalciuria in the pathogenesis of urolithiasis is re-examined in the light of new evidence.

AB  - Between May 1989 and November 1991, 19 staghorn calculi were treated by extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy (ESWL) with a Dornier MFL 5000 or Northgate SD-3. The 19 calculi were evaluated. Treatment was with monotherapy by ESWL in 9, combination percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PNL)-ESWL in 9, and nephrostomy in 1. Of the patients, 14 had a cross stent catheter pre-ESWL treatment to improve fragment evacuation. Radiologic follow up in 19 kidneys revealed that 57.9% were stone free. We arbitrarily separated our cases into 3 groups: struvite renal calculi, calcium carbonate calculi and others. Result of stone-free rate was 100% for stones consisting of struvite, and 14. 3% for stones consisting of calcium carbonate. In our opinion, the best indication of monotherapy by ESWL is for staghorn calculi, which consists of struvite, without marked dilation of pelvis and calyces.

AB  - Six healthy adult cats were fed a basal minced beef meat and rice diet with varying amounts or combinations of acidifying and alkalizing additives (ammonium chloride, calcium and sodium carbonate). The base excess in the food (mmol/kg dry matter) was calculated (data on food compounds in g/kg dry matter) as follows: base excess = 49.9*Ca + 82.3*Mg + 43.5*Na + 25.6*K - 64.6*P - 13.4*Met-16.6*Cystine -28.2*Cl. It amounted to between +305 and -1079 mmol/kg dry matter. Urine and blood pH as well as balance of minerals and water were determined in the cats. The mean urine pH ranged between 6.1 and 7.8. There was a highly significant correlation between the base excess in the food and the mean urine pH. The regression line was linear down to a base excess in the diet of about -400 to -500 mmol/kg dry matter and a pH in the urine of 6.2. The postprandial increase of urine pH was suppressed either by large amounts of ammonium chloride (> 780 mmol/kg dry matter) alone or in combination with calcium carbonate, but not in combination with sodium carbonate. The relationship between the decrease of the blood pH and the amount of ammonium chloride added to the diet was more marked than the relationship between blood pH and base excess in the food. In order to avoid health risks by long term application of acidifying diets it is recommended to formulate struvite diets with low base excess in such a way, that they contain as few alkalizing compounds as possible, which must be neutralized by acidifiers.

AB  - The term 'renal tubular acidosis' (RTA) applies to a group of disorders characterized by nonanion gap metabolic acidosis caused by abnormalities of the renal acidification mechanisms. Failure to thrive is the most prominent clinical feature and it is caused by sustained acidosis. Type 1 RTA is produced by an alteration in some of the distal mechanisms. The acidosis in this case is severe and progressive, is accompanied by hypercalciuria and may be complicated by nephrolithiasis and nephrocalcinosis. Hypokalemia is frequent, except for the 'voltage-dependent' subtype, where there is hyperkalemia. The treatment consists of alkali therapy. Potassium supplements are usually needed in the hypokalemic subtypes. Type 2 RTA is caused by a decrease in proximal bicarbonate reabsorption. It is frequently associated with other proximal tubule abnormalities, such as the Fanconi syndrome, but it may be isolated. Bone disease is frequent. Nephrolithiasis and nephrocalcinosis have not been described. Sodium bicarbonate and potassium supplements are also used for treatment of this type. Type 4 RTA is caused by aldosterone deficiency or resistance. Hyperkalemia is the main clinical feature. Different subtypes have been described. The treatment, again, consists of alkali therapy. In addition, some patients benefit from a high-Na+ diet. Cation exchange resins may be necessary in some cases. Mineralocorticoids are used in cases of hypoaldosteronism. © 2004 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Patients with crystalluric nephrolithiasis were treated orally with aqueous potassium citrate solution three times a day with a large quantity of water. After administration of potassium citrate, citric acid (P < 0.001) and potassium (P < 0.001) excretion was significantly increased. Increase in protein (P < 0.05) and uric acid (P < 0.05) excretion in urine revealed their association with the crystallization process. Crystals were absent in 12 (71%) out of 17 patients. Calcium excretion in urine was significantly decreased (P < 0.05). A decrease of calcium ions availability to oxalate ions to form calcium oxalate crystals may result in the prevention of calcium oxalate stone formation. © 1993. © 2014 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Of 8,129 specimens submitted as urinary stones from 6,095 patients, 67 from 15 patients were predominantly calcium carbonate or calcium magnesium carbonate (dolomite) by infrared analysis. Detailed study of 1 man and 4 women who submitted 3 or more such specimens showed that all were of aragonite calcium carbonate crystal form in 2 women and all calcite in the man. All 3 patients had a long history of nephrolithiasis preceding submission of calcium carbonate stones. There was frequent and often painful spontaneous passage of many small stones. Medullary sponge kidney was reported in 2 patients. Specimens submitted by the other 2 women included dolomite and quartz artifacts. Of the other 10 patients 4 had calcite and 1 had aragonite (possibly true stones). Five patients had artifacts with dolomite in 3 and mixed specimens in 2. True calcium carbonate kidney stones and calcium carbonate artifacts may be difficult to distinguish, and dolomite and quartz artifacts may require x-ray diffraction for clear-cut diagnosis. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Renal tubular acidosis represents a heterogenous group of disorders with various etiologies and mechanisms. The physiopathologic basis of each type of renal tubular acidosis is reviewed, focusing on the laboratory investigations necessary to define the nature of the hyperchloremic renal tubular acidosis. Clinically, the four types of renal tubular acidosis can be associated with complications such as osteomalacia, urolithiasis and failure to thrive. Very often, the chronic administration of alkali results in normal growth and development, and greatly reduces the risk of stone formation or nephrocalcinosis. © 2004 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - We report a case of a 30-year-old female who had a long-term history of trisilicate-containing antacid intake for gastric discomfort. She had experienced repeated attacks of renal colic. Neither intravenous pyelography nor ureteroscopy could define the presence of calculi. The metabolic evaluations were normal. However, X-ray diffraction revealed a silicate stone. We suggest that the attack of renal colic in those patients with long-term history of trisilicate intake should arouse the possibility of silica urolithiasis. © 1993 Informa UK Ltd. © 2014 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Principles in the dietary management of urolithiasis which have been successful in small animal cases were implemented in an equine case. This article describes the dietary management of a horse which repeatedly formed calcium carbonate cystic calculi. Treatment management included progressively decreasing the ration calcium content to reduce the intake of calcium. In addition, urinary tract infections were controlled and urinary acidification was used to inhibit calcium carbonate formation. Successful management was achieved by feeding a 0.2% calcium oat hay ration and administering 175 mg ammonium sulfate per kg body weight orally twice daily for 7 months which produced a urine pH of 5.0. There was no evidence of metabolic acid/base imbalances nor skeletal depletion of calcium. The horse has been free of cystic calculi for an additional 30 months while adequately maintained on a nutritionally balanced oat hay ration. Reducing dietary calcium intake and urine pH are possible management procedures in the horse with recurrent cystic calculi. © 1992, William E. Jones. All rights reserved.

AB  - Milk of calcium (MOC) in a small renal cyst or calyceal diverticulum is quite common. Ninety-one small renal cysts with MOC in 61 patients were found within a period of 4 years and 7 months. The main sonographic features are echogenic material layering in the dependent portion of a cyst, associated with reverberation echoes without shadowing. Shadowing was seen when MOC was present in larger amounts. Because MOC is usually asymptomatic and requires no treatment, differentiation from other lesions such as calculi or angio-myolipomas is important for proper patient management. MOC is detected more readily by ultrasonography than by radiography or CT. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The authors report an original technique of transintestinal cutaneous diversion using the jejunum A 10 to 15 cm segment of jejunum is raised from the second loop and is attached to the skin transperitoneally. The stoma lies below the ureterojejunal anastomosis and the two ureters, sutured according to Wallace's technique, are implanted end-to-end into the proximal and extraperitonealised end at the height of the sacral promontory. 29 patients have been treated by this technique for various indications: 21 bladder tumors, 5 neurogenic bladders, 1 bladder exstrophy, 1 cervical cancer, 1 prostatic cancer. 15 patients (52%) had previously received pelvic irradiation. The mean follow-up was 47 months (2-192 months) and the mortality was zero. 4 patients (13.8% developed early complications: 2 cases of urinary tract obstruction and 2 intestinal obstructions requiring 3 operations. 6 patients developed 7 minor late complications (24.1%): 2 cases of pyelonephritis, 4 cases of renal stones, only one of which required an operation, and 1 case of prolapsed stoma. None of the patients developed any alteration in renal function or dilatation of the upper urinary tract after the operation. The addition of sodium bicarbonate was found to be useless, as none of the patients developed any metabolic disorders. Transjejunal cutaneous ureterostomy achieves excellent drainage by means of a short graft with a stoma situated below the level of the ureteric implantation, as reflected by the absence of any long-term deterioration in renal function despite full lumen ureterojejunal implantation without an antireflux device. This technique is simple to perform and is indicated in all situations, particularly after pelvic irradiation. It is associated with low morbidity, no mortality and ensures an excellent long-term result. This record is sourced from MEDLINE®/PubMed®, a database of the U.S. National Library of Medicine

AB  - Abstract. Pancreatic juice is supersaturated in calcium carbonate. CaCO<inf>3</inf> crystal growth is controlled by lithostathine, a secretory protein synthesized by pancreatic acinar cells, first described as a constituent of pancreatic stones. It was recently reported that, in the thin descending limb of the Henle's loop, urine was supersaturated in CaCO<inf>3</inf> (Coe FL, Parks JH: Defenses of an unstable compromise: crystallization inhibitors and the kidney's role in mineral regulation. Kidney Int. 1990: 38, 625–631. This observation suggested the presence in kidney of a similar inhibitor. In this study, we show that a protein immunologically related to lithostathine is actually present in urine of healthy subjects and in renal stones. Immunocytochemistry of kidney sections localized the protein to cells of the proximal tubules and thick ascending limbs of the Henle's loops. Protein extracts of renal stones inhibited CaCO<inf>3</inf>crystal growth in vitro and this inhibition was significantly lifted by incubating the extracts with antibodies to lithostathine. The protein is not immunologically related to nephrocalcin. Because of its structural and functional similarities with pancreatic lithostathine, it was called renal lithostathine.

AB  - Previous in vitro experiments demonstrated the reduced microhardness of calcium oxalate monohydrate (COM) calculi, relative to dry values when sat urated with an alkaline solution (pH = 9.5). Nineteen patients with a COM calculus in the distal ureter which had been resistant to prior extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy in situ, were treated when the stone was surrounded by alkaline urine. The urine of 14 patients was alkalinized orally by administra tion of acetazolamine and citrate solution; in 5 other patients direct percuta neous irrigation of sodium bicarbonate via a nephrostomy tube was carried out. The urinary pH just before lithotripsy was ≥ 9 in 17/19 patients. 4,000 shock waves, averaging 18.1 kV generated by the Siemens Lithostar, were delivered onto the calculus. No significant increase of comminution rate was apparent at radiographic control immediately after the treatment and only in half of the cases was evacuation obtained within 3 months. © 1992 S.

AB  - Experience with chemodissolution of uric acid stones in 30 patients is presented. Chemodissolution was achieved either with infusion of 0.16 M i.v. lactate or oral sodium bicarbonate, in addition to liberal fluid intake and allopurinol wherever indicated. In some cases direct chemodissolution by in situ irrigation with sodium bicarbonate solution was done after an initial percutaneous nephrostomy. Seven patients presented with acute obstructive anuria. In this group, 5 of them had bilateral obstructive calculi, while 2 had unilateral obstruction in a solitary kidney. The latter 2 had complete recovery following intravenous lactate therapy. Of the 5 presenting with bilateral obstruction, 2 patients had complete response to chemodissolution, whereas the remaining 3 had only a partial response requiring surgery for ultimate salvage. In this group I, 6 patients are doing well with a normal serum creatinine at 3 months to 4 years follow-up, while 1 patient has a serum creatinine, stabilised at 3.2 mg%. In the second group, 23 patients presented with non-obstructing urinary stones. Flank pain was the commonest complaint and a concomitant history of gout was present in 6 patients. Hyperuricaemia was detected in 12 and hyperuricosuria in 19. All cases were managed by high fluid intake and oral sodium bicarbonate, with self-monitoring of urine pH, which was kept between 6.5 and 7.0. Allopurinol was administered in cases having hyperuricaemia and/or hyperuricosuria. Systemic alkali therapy in the form of intravenous molar lactate or sodium bicarbonate is effective and safe both in obstructive anuria and non-obstructive urinary uric acid stones. © 1992 S.

AB  - Seven patients (13.0%) among 54 patients with inflammatory bowel disease treated by extensive colonic resection were complicated by renal stone. The mean urinary pH value in cases complicated by renal stones (5.3±0.4) was significantly lower than among those without stones (6.1±0.3, P<0.01). Sodium bicarbonate (4 gm/day, q.i.d.), was given to 11 patients with renal stones and/or hematuria, whose urinary pH was lower than 5.0, or whose urinary sediments were positive for uric acid crystals since Oct. 1985. Their urinary pH and Na concentration increased significantly and no renal stone complication has been seen in the treated group. © 1991 The Japanese Society of Gastroenterology. © 2008 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The occurance of the urinary stones varies according to the geographical regions. The presence of stones in the urinary system causes pain and discomfort. These generate colics and hence are sometimes life threatening. In the present study, infrared measurements have been made on several stone samples. It has been found that calcium oxalate, calcium phosphate, magnesiunm ammonium phosphate, calcium carbonate, uric acid, ℓ-cystine and xanthin are present, as expected. Also, silicon dioxide is found to be present in some of the stones but in small quantity, in addition to the above constituents. This constituent is responsible to exhibit piezoelectricity in the urinary calculi. © 1991 Plenum Publishing Corporation. © 2007 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - A 66-year-old female visited our university hospital with the chief complaint of right lower abdominal pain in July, 1984. Kidney-ureter-bladder roentgenograms disclosed the right ureter stone and several left renal stones. She passed the right ureter stone composed of calcium oxalate. Thereafter, she passed small stones twice and sand stones twice until September, 1985. The stone analysis revealed two of them as silica. Although most patients with silica stones reported in Japan had a history of long-term medication of magnesium trisilicate, this patient had not taken this drug. Silica stones are rare and fifteen cases including the present case have been reported in Japan. This record is sourced from MEDLINE®/PubMed®, a database of the U.S. National Library of Medicine

AB  - A 62-year-old male visited our department complaining of left flank pain and urinary retention on November 6, 1989. Intravenous pyelography showed small stone shadows in bilateral ureters and lower calyx of kidney and the left kidney was not visualized. Endoscopically, calculi were seen in bilateral ureteral orifice. An ureteral catheter could not be passed up from there bilaterally. On November 13, 1989, January 24 and 26, 1990, calculi were passed out spontaneously. Analysis of the stones revealed silica calculus. The patient had a past history of duodenal ulcers. He was administered magnesium silicate and magnesium alminometasilicate as an anti-acid drug for ten years. Sixteen cases of silica calculus in Japan are reviewed.

AB  - The post‐initiation enhancing activities of the non‐genotoxic agent NaHCO<inf>3</inf> and the genotoxic agent N‐ethyl‐]N‐(4‐hydroxybuty])nitrosainine (EHBN) in combination with uracil‐induced urolithiasis were investigated in a rat bladder carcinogenesis model. Animals were treated with 0.05%N‐butyl‐N‐(4‐hydroxybutyl)nitrosamine (BBN) for 4 weeks, and then 3% uracil was given for 3 weeks in the early (weeks 4‐7), middle (weeks 8 11) or late (weeks 12–15) post‐initiation phase. In addition, administration of 3% NaHCO<inf>3</inf>, 20 ppm EHBN or no chemical supplement was performed for the 13 weeks when the rats were not receiving BBN or uracil. NaHCO<inf>3</inf> in sequential combination with early and middle stages uracil treatment strongly enhanced tumorigenesis in the urinary bladder, while EHBN treatment amplified lesion development at the middle stage only of uracil treatment. DNA synthesis and associated epithelial surface alterations observed by scanning electron microscopy tended to be increased in the NaHCO<inf>3</inf> and EHBN groups without BBN initiation, independently of uracil treatment timing. The present results demonstrated that uracil‐induced urolithiasis during the middle post‐initiation phase is highly active in enhancing bladder tumor development under the influence of a promoter or carcinogen.

AB  - Intravenous pyelography (IVP), retrograde ureteral catheterization and percutaneous nephrostomy (PCN) have been used to locate radiolucent stones during ESWL in an X-ray localization system lithotripter. We also used an alternative method combining PCN, ESWL and chemolysis to treat 8 consecutive uric acid stones. The average number of shock wave pulses was 1,725 (range 1,000-2,000), the generator voltage of the HM-3 Dornier lithotripter was 20-22 kV, and the local chemolysis lasted 4 days (range 2-7). All radiolucent uric acid stones were successfully disintegrated. Of the 8 patients treated, 5 were completely free of stones and the other 3 had insignificant residual stones after 3 months. Three patients who developed fever during local chemolysis with 0.1 M sodium bicarbonate solution were managed conservatively without severe sequelae. Only 1 patient retained a PCN tube after discharge. Because PCN can provide a path for local chemolysis and better localization, it is especially helpful in treating obstructive uric acid stones. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Sixty-three patients with hypocitraturia (44.9% of the total) and 33 patients with hypomagnesiuria (24.8% of the total) received oral magnesium hydroxide and/or Na/K citrate in addition to other therapeutic agents if indicated and a common-sense diet. Hypocitraturic patients were categorized into 3 groups and received 27-81 mEq/day oral citrate according to the deficiency grade. Hypomagnesiuric patients also formed two groups according to the deficiency grade and received 500 and 1,000 mg/day magnesium hydroxide, respectively. Replacement was intermittent and was controlled every 3 months until reaching normal values. We evaluated 28 of 63 hypocitraturic and 15 of 33 hypomagnesiuric patients who had inhibitory deficiency as the sole causal factor of their urolithiasis. After a follow-up of 13.5 ± 10.2 months, no patient in either group developed a new stone. Citrate and magnesium were increased significantly in the respective groups; calcium and oxalate excretion was lowered, and urine pH and volume increased significantly. A deficiency grade-adjusted and intermittent replacement therapy with Mg and citrate is very effective, has less side effects and ensures good patient compliance. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The aim of this study was to determine whether extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) affected the viability of the infecting bacteria within a simulated struvite stone matrix. A strain, Proteus mirabilis 28cii, was prepared in three forms: (1) suspended in saline and urine, (2) artificially encapsulated by suspending in agar beads and (3) artificially encapsulated and mineralised by suspending in agar beads with calcium carbonate crystals. The preparations were placed in capped vials partially immersed in degassed water and held in the focal point of the Siemens Lithostar and given 1,000 shocks. Subsequent viability testing showed that bacteria suspended in urine were greatly affected by shock treatments (55% loss in viability), but incorporation into agar beads negated this effect (even if the cells were exposed to 2000 shocks). Mineralisation of the beads with calcium carbonate crystals caused a decrease in viability of 82% that was significantly different from controls. However, this still left 2.3×108 viable organisms (82% of 2.8×108), easily enough to form the focus for further infections. A series of control experiments carried out using an ultrasonic cell sonicator probe gave comparable results to those obtained with ESWL. These results demonstrate that ESWL treatment of infected stones must be accompanied by antimicrobial coverage. © 1990 Springer-Verlag. © 2007 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - By controlling evaporation, calcium carbonate (calcite) is precipitated together with calcium oxalate monohydrate from equimolar (1 x 10-5 M) solutions of calcium chloride and sodium oxalate under decreasing (37.5° - 32.7° C) and increasing temperature (22° - 42°, 22° - 45°, 22° - 50°C), and initial pH's of 6.6 and 6, respectively. If, however, the pH of the solutions is, respectively, 8 and 8.5 and the temperature is 32°C, oxalate breaks down to carbonate and calcium precipitates solely as calcite.

AB  - We report a case of silicate calculi with no history of taking magnesium trisilicate. A 33-year-old woman was sent to our hospital as an emergency case because of severe right lower flank pain. Physical examination was unremarkable except for severe right cost-vertebral angle knock pain. She denied administration of a magnesium trisilicate anti-acid before. She was admitted to the urologic ward since the pain did not relieve in spite of several analgesics. The stone passed spontaneously on the third hospital day. Analysis by infrared spectrophotometry demonstrated the composition to be over 98% of silicate. A review of the literatures discloses only 21 cases of silicate stones.

AB  - The occurance of the urinary stones varies according to the geographical regions. The presence of stones in the urinary system causes pain and discomfort. These generate colics and hence are sometimes life threatening. In the present study, infrared measurements have been made on several stone samples. It has been found that calcium oxalate, calcium phosphate, magnesium ammonium phosphate, calcium carbonate, uric acid,l-cystine and xanthin are present, as expected. Also, silicon dioxide, is found to be present in some of the stones but in small quantity, in addition to the above constituents. This constituent is responsible to exhibit piezoelectricity in the urinary calculi. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Calcium oxalate (CaOx) is the most common constituent of calcium renal stones, often mixed with calcium phosphate (CaP). The recurrence rate of these stones is high and their aetiology complex. Despite new effective, less invasive methods to remove the stones, preventive treatment is often necessary to avoid recurrence. Alkaline citrate is a relatively new medical treatment reported to give a stone free rate of between 67-92 per cent in long term studies with three daily doses. The present investigation was undertaken in order to study further the risk factors in CaOx stone formation, the influence and usefulness of a single evening dose of alkaline citrate, and the value of a four hour morning urine sample in the evaluation of patients who form stones. The highest CaOx crystallisation risk (CaOx-CR) in whole urine was recorded in the pH range 4.5-5.5, with lower values above this pH. Between pH 6.5-7.5 the number of small CaP crystals was considerably increased. The crystallisation of CaOx on hydroxyapatite (HAP) was inhibited for four hours by 1 and 2% whole urine or citrate in concentrations of 1% that in normal urine. The formation of CaP crystals in a supersaturated system was considerably reduced when citrate concentrations exceeded 0.5 mmol/l. The number of medium sized (6.5-14 microns) and large crystals (15.5-27 microns) was reduced, and small crystals (3.5-5 microns) predominated at higher citrate concentrations. The correlation between the composition of 24-h urine samples and 4-h urine specimens collected between 0600-1000, from patients with CaOx stones before and during a course of alkaline citrate given as a single evening dose was good, with the best correlation recorded during treatment. These results suggest that the 4-h urine sample might be adequate for the follow up of patients treated with alkaline citrate. A total amount of 7.5 g of potassium sodium citrate (PSC) in 1, 2, and 3 doses favourably affected urine composition in patients with CaOx stones. Three doses gave the most sustained effect, and a single evening dose gave the most pronounced effect between 2200-0600. Long term treatment (mean +/- SD duration 3.5 +/- 1.7 years) of patients who formed calcium stones with PSC in a single evening dose of 3.75 or 5.0 g (n = 55) gave a stone free rate of 75 per cent, but no clinical effect was apparent when 5.0 or 7.5 g were given in two or three doses (n = 17).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS) This record is sourced from MEDLINE®/PubMed®, a database of the U.S. National Library of Medicine

AB  - A 29‐year‐old insulin‐dependent diabetic woman developed phosphate depletion, nephrolithiasis and bilateral ureteric obstruction due to antacid abuse. Unlike previous descriptions of chronic phosphate depletion, myalgia, weakness and bone pain were absent. Biochemical features included hypophosphataemia, hypercalciuria, hypophosphaturia, elevated plasma 1,25‐dihydroxyvitamin D and low plasma intact parathyroid hormone. These abnormalities were corrected when antacid ingestion was reduced and phosphate intake supplemented. Wepropose that phosphate depletion secondary to antacid abuse caused 1α‐hydroxylase activation and elevation of the plasma 1,25‐dihydroxyvitamin D level, leading to marked hypercalciuria. Once diagnosed, antacid abuse is a readily reversible cause of hypercalciuria and renal stones. Moreover, antacid‐induced phosphate depletion may present with nephrolithiasis in the absence of musculoskeletal symptoms. This report is intended to draw attention to this important cause of renal stone disease. Copyright © 1990, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The recent development of gallstone fragmentation methods has increased the significance of the study of the mechanical properties of human gallstones. In the present work, fracture strength data and microhardness values of gallstones of various chemical compositions are presented as tested in both dry and simulated bile environments. Generally, both gallstone hardness and fracture strength values were significantly less than kidney stone values found in previous studies. However, a single calcium carbonate stone was found to have an outer shell hardness exceeding those values found for kidney stones. Diametral compression measurements in simulated bile conclusively demonstrated low gallstone fracture strength as well as brittle fracture in the stones tested. Based on the results of this study, one may conclude that the wide range of gallstone microhardnesses found may explain the reported difficulties previous investigators have experienced using various fragmentation techniques on specific gallstones. Moreover, gallstone mechanical properties may be relatively sensitive to bile‐environment composition. Copyright © 1990 John Wiley & Sons, Inc. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Sheep were used to study factors previously found to promote silica urolithiasis in a rat model. In addition to high silica, these dietary factors included elevated calcium, a high calcium to phosphorus ratio and alkali-forming effects. Wether lambs had ad libitum access to a diet of 50% of grass hay and 50% ground oats plus supplement. Diet analysis was 3.4% total SiO2, .29% calcium, .25% phosphorus, 11.3% CP and 28% ADF. Treatments (40 lambs/treatment) consisted of a control (C), limestone to increase dietary calcium to .6% (L), L + 1% sodium bicarbonate (LS) and L + 1% ammonium chloride (LA). After a 91-d experimental period followed by a 56-d postexperimental finishing period, silica kidney deposits were found in all treatments, and SiO2 made up 74% to 97% of the urolithic ash. Kidney urolith incidences in the four treatments were C, 7/40; L, 12/40; LS, 20/40; and LA, 9/40. A higher urolith incidence in LS (LS vs C, P less than .05) and a trend toward a higher incidence in L (L vs C, P less than .2), accompanied by elevated urine pH (L = LS greater than C greater than LA, P less than .01), lend support to the concept that high-silica diets having high calcium to phosphorus ratios and alkali-forming potentials contribute to silica urolithiasis.

AB  - Calculus formation in the renal transplanted patient is uncommon and usually represents a late complication of secondary hyperparathyroidism. A case report of a gouty patient with a transplanted cadaveric kidney is presented. The patient presented without hypercalcemia, or urinary infection, or renal tubular acidosis, or ureteral obstruction, or ingestion of antacids, or metabolic disease, or previous graft lithiasis. Five months after transplantation, a large stone within the renal pelvis was observed on an x-ray film. The radiotransparent nucleus, the patient’s past history and the acute gouty arthritis he presented in the immediate postoperative period suggested that the nucleus of the calculus might be mainly composed of uric acid. These facts have drawn our attention to the control of the purine metabolism in the renal transplanted patients who have a past history consistent with gout. © 1990 S.

AB  - Milk of calcium renal stone refers to an entity described in connection to a similar condition in gallbladder disease. The intrarenal accumulation of calcium carbonate imitates a calcific density and frequently is located within a caliceal diverticulum or a pyelogenic cyst. Symptomatology, if present, mainly refers to a continuous flank distress but colicky pain complaints are rare. The diagnosis is radiological. The typical impression of a shifting fluid level is apparent when comparing x-rays with the patient in the supine position, and in the upright and lateral projections.

AB  - It is well known that infection-induced stones (apatite, struvite), uric acid and cystine calculi in the urinary tract can be managed by the use of certain chemical solutions. We investigated the effects of various acidic and alkaline solutions on the rabbit urothelium. Acidic solutions (pH: 4.2) caused more urothelial injury as compared to alkaline solutions (pH: 7.6). Ureteral injury was more severe than the bladder injury. Magnesium-containing solutions caused less injury to the urothelium. © 1990 S. Karger AG, Basel. © 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Magnesium oxide, magnesium hydroxide, magnesium sulfate, magnesium trisilicate, and magnesium citrate were added to a calcium-oxalate lithogenic diet in order to determine their effects in preventing lithogenesis. Male Wistar-strain rats which had been fed the glycolic-acid diet developed marked urinary calculi within four weeks. Rats in the magnesium-hydroxide, magnesium-citrate, and magnesium-trisilicate groups, however, had almost no stones in the urinary system. Rats in the magnesium-oxide and magnesium-sulfate groups, showed significantly less effect than those in the former three groups. During the experimental period, the 24-hour urinary oxalate excretion and concentration were higher in the glycolic-acid group than in the other groups. The urinary citrate excretion and concentration were the highest in the magnesium-hydroxide and magnesium-citrate groups and higher in the magnesium-trisilicate and magnesium-oxide groups than in the magnesium-sulfate and glycolic-acid groups. Simialr trends were observed in the urinary magnesium excretion and in its concentration. The urinary calcium excretion and concentration were higher in the experimental groups than in the glycolic-acid group. The urinary calcium/magnesium ratio remained mostly unchanged. Therefore, it can be concluded that alkaline magnesium salts increase the urinary calcium and magnesium concentrations, without changing the calcium/magnesium ratio, and inhibit urinary calculi formation, most likely by increasing the urinary citrate concentration. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Surgical treatments for urolithiasis in the upper urinary tract are reviewed on the basis of operation statistics at the Department of Urology, Osaka University Hospital for the past 30 years from 1957 to 1986. Open surgery was applied for 1,624 patients with urolithiasis in the kidney and ureter during this period. These operations accounted for 14.4% of the 11,300 cases of urological surgery at our department. Types and frequency of operations for urolithiasis were as follows: ureterolithotomies 697 cases (6.2%), pyelolithotomies including extended pyelotomy 376 cases (3.3%), nephrolithotomies 294 cases (2.6%), partial nephrectomies 132 cases (1.2%) and nephrectomies 125 cases (1.1%).

AB  - The dissolution of infectious renal concrements by means of percutaneous nephrostomy or ureteral catheter often requires lavage lasting several weeks. Using an experiment in vitro, the authors tried to reduce this interval by means of ultrasound. By combination of the physical effect of ultrasound with that of chemolytic dissolution of the infectious concrement was significantly accelerated. Thus, simultaneous intermittent ultrasound application to the body's surface during dissolution could considerably reduce the time needed for the concrement to dissolve in vivo.

AB  - Idiopathic hypercalciuria, defined as the urinary excretion of more than 300 mg. calcium per day in men or more than 250 mg. calcium per day in women, or more than 4 mg. calcium per kg. per day, is observed in about 50 per cent of the patients with calcium oxalate/apatite nephrolithiasis and is one of the risk factors for stone formation. These patients do not exhibit hypercalcemia, elevated serum parathyroid hormone concentrations or urinary cyclic adenosine monophosphate excretion nor clinical evidence of sarcoidosis, other granulomas or a malignancy. Hypophosphatemia may be present. Augmented rates of intestinal absorption of dietary calcium account for most of the increments in urinary calcium. Serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D concentrations are in the upper normal range or elevated among many patients and are normal but not suppressed in the others. Activation of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D formation may be secondary to hypophosphatemia or other, as yet undefined, factors. Since, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D apparently can up-regulate its own receptor, small increments in its synthesis and blood levels could amplify the effect of the hormone to stimulate intestinal calcium absorption. Calcium balances are slightly but significantly negative and urinary hydroxyproline excretion may be increased so that a generalized disorder of calcium homeostasis also involving bone may be present. Additional studies are required to determine the genetic basis for the occurrence of idiopathic hypercalciuria in families, the cause of greater expression of idiopathic hypercalciuria in men and whether environmental factors (high dietary sodium chloride, protein and purified carbohydrate intakes) contribute to the expression of idiopathic hypercalciuria. Although thiazide diuretics, inorganic phosphate, magnesium hydroxide and potassium citrate have provided effective therapy, prospective studies are needed to determine optimum therapy and the optimum duration of treatment. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Studies in 24 recurrent oxalate stone-formers have shown that values for urinary calcium excretion for this group on at-home diets vary significantly (P<0.001) more than values for creatinine excretions. By placing stone-formers on controlled in-hospital diets and measuring their calcium excretions, we were able to predict probable outpatient hypercalciuria (>7.5 mmol/day) with a sensitivity of 95% and a specificity of 95%. In this study, the renal loss of calcium during low-calcium diets was proportional to the absorptive hypercalciuria during high-calcium diets. Calcium loading experiments in fasted stone-formers and normal subjects indicated that citrate, at citrate:calcium molar ratios ranging from 0.12 to 1, stimulated urinary calcium excretion more than did calcium carbonate loading alone. In addition, citrate also significantly (P<0.05) increased the excretion of urinary oxalate by two normal subjects for a given load of calcium oxalate. Malabsorption of citrate and possibly other hydroxycarboxylic acids may thus predispose to oxalate nephrolithiasis by promoting calcium and oxalate absorption. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The influence of certain dietary elements on the urolithiasis syndrome in cattle calves was elucidated. Calcium, phosphorus, and magnesium measurements were conducted on feed rations as well as on serum and urine samples collected from affected and normal calves. Analysis of the rations given to the animals showed phosphorus at higher levels than calcium, indicating mineral imbalance. Serum and urine of urolithic calves were characterised by high phosphorus, calcium, magnesium, urea, and creatinine levels. Physical examination of urine of affected animals showed a high degree of turbidity, a large amount of calcium carbonate, and triple phosphate as well as abundant amount of pus cells and red blood cells. The characteristic clinical symptoms of urine retention were observed. Moreover, some animals were found to urinate through an opening in front of the scrotal region.

AB  - A 38 year old female underwent a proctocolectomy and ileostomy for ulcerative colitis in February, 1974. For 8 year post-operatively, she excreted innumerable renal stones, mainly composed of uric acid. Her urine was highly acidic and hyperuricosuric with a low concentration of sodium. Sodium bicarbonate 4 gm/day, t.i.d., was started in October 1985, after which her renal stone excretion completely ceased (up until March, 1987), except for one incidence of stone excretion when she discontinued therapy for a week. During the sodium bicarbonate therapy, her urinary pH and Na concentration were elevated. Furthermore, sodium bicarbonate significantly elevated the urinary pH and Na concentration of other ileostomy patients. Thus, sodium bicarbonate could be used for the possible prophylaxis of uric acid formation in selected ileostomy patients. © 1988 The Japan Surgical Society. © 2008 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Sixteen patients with medullary sponge kidney (MSK) and renal stones underwent evaluation of calcium metabolism and acid base balance. Six normal subjects and eight patients with non-MSK absorptive hypercalciuria served as control. Nine (56%) were hypercalciuric and seven (44%) were normocalciuric (N-MSK). Hypercalciuria was divided into absorptive (AH-MSK, n=2) and renal leak hyerpcalciuria (RH-MSK, n=7). The mean of minimal urine pH of RH-MSK group (5.28±0.09 (SE)) was significantly higher than that of normal control (4.78±0.12) and of non-MSK AH (4.80±0.6) during acute acid challenge. The mean of the arterial blood HCO<inf>3</inf> concentration of RH-MSK group was significantly lower than that of two control groups. The urine calcium and a frequency of stone passage were decreased significantly after alkali treatment in RH-MSK. © 1988 Springer-Verlag. © 2007 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - One of the major causes of mortality in poultry is urolithiasis. Although two of the major causes of urolithiasis have been defined, active and preventative treatments for this disease have not been extensively field tested. Previous research demonstrated that a diet acidified with NH4Cl was effective in preventing the formation of uroliths in 16-wk-old pullets. In the present study, experiments were designed to evaluate the effects of dietary acidification and alkalinization on preformed uroliths in mature laying hens. Urolithiasis was induced by feeding excess dietary Ca (in commercial layer ration) during pullet growout (6 to 18 wk of age) and during the early laying period (18 to 32 wk of age). At 32 wk of age birds were randomly divided into three diet treatment groups: a normal layer ration group, an acidified layer ration group (1% NH4Cl added); and an alkalinized layer ration group (1% NaHCO3 added). Each group received the respective diets until 52 wk of age, when the experiment was terminated. Blood gas analysis at 44 wk of age demonstrated that hens fed the acidified diet had significantly higher blood H+ concentrations, lower blood bicarbonate concentrations, and lower total blood carbon dioxide levels than hens fed the alkalinized layer ration. At 52 wk of age, hens fed the acidified layer ration had higher urinary H+ concentrations, higher blood H+ concentrations, and lower blood HCO3 and total CO2 concentrations than hens fed the normal and alkalinized layer rations. The acidified layer ration group had no uroliths present in their ureters (0% urolithiasis), whereas the normal and alkalinized layer ration groups had 8.3 and 13.1% incidences of urolithiasis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) This record is sourced from MEDLINE/PubMed, a database of the U.S. National Library of Medicine

AB  - Citrate is used commonly as an alkalinizing agent and in the management of nephrolithiasis, but its quantitative effect on acid-base homeostasis, as judged by changes in renal net acid excretion, has not been delineated. We therefore administered 61 mEq of sodium citrate/day for 4 days to 10 normal volunteers and compared the results to those obtained in 10 normal subjects (4 of whom also participated in the citrate protocol) given 60 mEq/day for 4 days of sodium bicarbonate, the prototypical alkalinizing agent. We found that the sodium citrate group experienced an average reduction in net acid excretion (45.5±7.2 mEq/day) that was very similar to that (42.0±7.2 mEq/day) induced by the same amount of sodium bicarbonate. In both groups, the reduction in net acid excretion was equivalent to approximately 70% of the alkali administered. The latter appeared to relate to an average negative hydrogen ion balance of approximately 15 mEq/day, since there was an increase in blood [HCO<inf>3</inf>] in each group of about 2.5 mEq/l. We conclude that the findings demonstrate that the short-term effects of sodium citrate on acid-base homeostasis in normal subjects are indistinguishable from those of sodium bicarbonate. © 2004 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.; Medline is the source for the MeSH terms of this document.

AB  - We examined the effectiveness of chlorthalidone or magnesium hydroxide in the prevention of recurrent calcium oxalate kidney calculi. In a double-blind random allocation design daily dosages of 25 or 50 mg. chlorthalidone, 650, or 1,300 mg. magnesium hydroxide, or an identical placebo were administered. All groups showed significantly decreased calculous events compared to the pretreatment rates. During the trial 56.1 per cent fewer calculi than predicted developed in the placebo group (p less than 0.01), whereas the groups receiving low and high dosage magnesium hydroxide showed 73.9 and 62.3 per cent fewer calculi, respectively (p less than 0.001 and less than 0.01, respectively). Chlorthalidone treatment resulted in a 90.1 per cent decrease from predicted rates and both dosages yielded similar results. When the treatments were compared chlorthalidone was significantly better than the placebo or magnesium hydroxide (p less than 0.01). The large decreases in calculous events seen when placebo or ineffective therapy was given underscore the positive treatment bias that occurs when historical controls are used and they demonstrate the need for proper experimental design. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Although cystine stones account for 1 to 3 per cent of renal calculi, many of these patients are difficult to manage because of recurrent urolithiasis. Seven cases of homozygous cystinuria are summarized. The evolution to the present treatment of percutaneous extraction and chemolysis appears to be the preferred form of treatment although extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) may also be utilized. In addition, in vitro experiments were conducted to study the effectiveness of different chelating agents and buffers at different urinary pHs. The effect of cystinuric and noncystinuric urines was also evaluated. © 1988. © 2014 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - We studied urine calcium and magnesium excretions during treatment with adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH-T) and ketogenic diet (KD-T) in 5 intractable epileptic children. The daily urine calcium excretion was evaluated by the urinary calcium/creatinine ratio (U-Ca/Cr) of 24-hour urine or urine specimens passed early in the morning. In all cases U-Ca/Cr rose and the urinary magnesium/calcium ratio (U-Mg/Ca) decreased during both ACTH-T and KD-T. These changes were normalized gradually after the end of treatment. Serum calcium and phosphate showed no significant changes during both treatments, while serum alkaline phosphatase were reduced during ACTH-T and increased during KD-T. But urinary excretion of oxalate measured in two patients during ACTH-T and in a patient during KD-T revealed no definite changes. Hydrochlorothiazide was not effective for prevention of hypercalciuria in a patient who had experienced urolithiasis during the previous ACTH-T. Sodium bicarbonate prevented the elevation of U-Ca/Cr during KD-T, but aggravated epileptic seizures. U-Mg/Ca was improved by magnesium oxide during KD-T. It is well known that both glucocorticoids and metabolic acidosis cause hypercalciuria by increasing tubular reabsorption of calcium. It is also thought that increase of U-Ca/Cr and decrease of U-Mg/Ca predispose patients to suffer from urinary stones of calcium oxalate. Our study suggests that both ACTH-T and KD-T could induce hypercalciuria and reduce U-Mg/Ca. It is important to give careful consideration to urine calcium and magnesium excretions during treatment of intractable epilepsy in children. © 1988, The Japanese Society of Child Neurology.

AB  - Hematuria is a frequent complication in burn patients, but its clinical significance has not been reported. The incidence, etiologies, treatment, and outcome of hematuria in 1,785 burn patients treated from 1964 to 1983, have been reviewed. Ninety-one patients had hematuria (>15 RBC/HPF with unspun urine). There were five main causes: urinary infections-(UTI), 50 cases; renal calculi (RC), 14 cases, including 3% and 5% total body surface area burn patients; catheter trauma, 7 cases; renal vein thrombosis (RVT), 5 cases; and acute renal failure (ATN), 4 cases. Ten patients died in the UTI group, five with Candida as the infecting organism. No RC patients died, but two required surgical extraction of their stones. This incidence of RC may be due to large intake of dairy products and antacids and to prolonged immobilization. The catheter trauma group had no deaths and was the youngest group. One RVT patient was diagnosed clinically and successfully treated surgically. The other three were diagnosed at necropsy. The ATN patients all developed renal failure late as part of multiple organ system failure and all died. We conclude hematuria is a serious finding in burn patients and prompt diagnosis of its etiology and treatment are essential for maintaining renal function and patient survival. © 1987 Grune & Stratton, Inc. © 2014 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Fifteen burned children were noted to have developed renal calculi at our institution over the past 20 years. Primary risk factors appear to be immobilization and a high intake of dairy products and antacids. Presenting symptoms and physical signs include abdominal pain, haematuria, with transient leukocytosis and elevations of the blood urea nitrogen. Conservative therapy with increased fluid administration and urine acidification were successful in 13 of the patients. The remaining two patients required surgical extraction. There were no long-term renal sequelae in any of the patients. © 1987. © 2014 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Dissolution of uric acid calculi could be obtained by oral or parenteral urinary alcalinization, but this method cannot apply to the case of obstructive calculi. Nineteen obstructive calculi in 18 patients were treated by in situ alcalinization through a percutaneous nephrostomy catheter (PCN). Eight patients were initially anuric, 7 of whom from an obstructed solitary kidney and 1 from a bilateral obstructive lithiasis. Fifteen calculi were located in the ureter, 3 in the uretero-pelvic junction and 1 in the pelvis. After 48 h of urinary diversion through PCN, an isotonic sodium bicarbonate solution (14 g %) was continuously infused at an average flow rate of 2.8 l/24 h, through either an unique PCN, or a 2 PCN-irrigation circuit in the 7 cases with permanently obstructive calculus. Fifteen calculi (80%) were completely dissolved after 3 to 13 days of alcalinization (average 5.8 days). One large calculus was reduced by 3/4 and further removed by percutaneous lithotripsy. Three patients underwent ureterotomy after 9 to 11 days of uneffective treatment. Local alcalinization is an effective and non invasive treatment for obstructive uric acid calculi, and is logically associated with the necessary urinary diversion.

AB  - Following the introduction of one or two percutaneous nephrostomy drains, 16 obstructive uric acid calculi were treated by perfusion of excretory cavities with 14% sodium bicarbonate solution. Twelve calculi had dissolved within an average of 5 days, 1 required percutaneous lithotripsy because of incomplete dissolution and 3 were unaltered. Success of this treatment appears to be dependent on the total radiotransparency of calculi, a feature difficult to demonstrate. There were no reports of major complications. The only weakly invasive nature of alkalinization in situ makes it a method of choice to be reserved for obstructive calculi, and a therapeutic strategy is proposed.

AB  - SUMMARY: Wet chemical tests have deficiencies when applied to mixtures containing silica, which are common in the uroliths of some domestic animals. Consequently, the applicability of an infrared spectroscopic method was tested on 104 uroliths obtained from cattle, sheep, goats, horses, pigs, dogs, a chicken and a rabbit during diagnostic investigations. The following components were satisfactorily identified: silica, calcium oxalate, calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate, magnesium ammonium phosphate, magnesium phosphate and urates. The infrared characteristics of these compounds and their mixtures are described. Copyright © 1986, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Calcium oxalate monohydrate, an important constituent of urinary stones, was spontaneously precipitated and electron microscopic examination of the precipitates revealed microcrystals of varied morphologies. The oxalate crystals undergo facile electron beam damage and do not yield any electron diffraction pattern characteristic of the monohydrate or its anhydrous form. On continuous scanning in the electron microscope, the oxalate phase is transformed to calcium carbonate (calcite) and/or calcium oxide. © 1986. © 2014 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - X-ray diffraction crystallography was used to determine the crystalline composition of 18 equine urinary calculi, including stones originating in the kidney, bladder and urethra. Calcium carbonate in the form of calcite was found to be the major component in all calculi examined. Other components commonly found included weddellite and substituted vaterite. Urine deposits from a number of normal horses were also examined. The significance of these findings, as well as those from a number of previous reports, are discussed in relation to the possible aetiology of urolithiasis in the horse.

AB  - Twenty cases of silia stones (including a personal one, the first case ever observed - April 1952) are reviewed. Almost all of the patients had been taking magnesium trisilicate for several years, one up to 40 years. The average age of the patients was 54 years. There were 9 males and 1 female. The patients came from the following locations, given in chronological order: Beirut, Lebanon (1952); Stockholm, Sweden (1953, 1962); Houston, Tex., USA (1958, 1961); New York, NY., USA (1960); Johannesburg, South Africa (1964); London, UK (1973, 1982); Osaka, Japan (1978); Madrid, Spain (1978, 1981); and Torrance, Calif., USA (1984). 14 patients passed out the stones spontaneously. In 3 patients, the stone was formed in the left kidney. Bilateral renal stones were found in 2 patients. In 2 patients, they were removed from the left ureter and in 2 patients they were found in the bladder. The size of the stones varied between 2 mm and 3 cm, the weight from 8 mg to 3.6 g. The silica stone is of relatively low radio density. Our case is the only one in whom the level of urinary silica was determined; it was of the order of 0.006% i.e. 1 mmol/l. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Crystalluria results from oversaturation of urine with crystallogenic substance. However, oversaturation may occur as a result of in vitro as well as in vivo events. The microscopic appearance of crystals only represents a tentative identification of their composition because variable conditions associated with their formation, growth, and dissolution may alter their appearance. Definitive identification is dependent on physical methods such as optical crystallography, x-ray diffraction, and electron microscopic analysis. © 2017 Medline is the source for the citation and abstract of this record.

AB  - Three experiments were conducted to determine the effects of excess dietary calcium carbonate, phosphorus and urine acidifying and alkalizing salts on silica urolith formation in a model using rats fed dextrose-based diets containing 2% tetraethylorthosilicate (TES). Diets containing 2% TES lowered weight gains to 91-95% of gains made by rats fed non-TES diets. Urine silica concentrations of rats fed TES were generally in the range of 50-60 mg/dl. In experiment 1, rats fed TES with no additional dietary calcium carbonate had a silica urolith incidence of 35%. With additions of 1 and 2% calicum carbonate to the basal-TES diet, respective urolith incidences were 45 and 60% (r = 0.99, P < 0.02). In experiment 2, monobasic sodium phosphate (MP) providing 0.2% additional phosphorus resulted in a mean urine pH of 6.42 and no uroliths. Dibasic sodium phosphate (DP) without and with 0.5% sodium bicarbonate (SB) resulted in respective urine pH values of 6.78 and 7.14 and urolith incidences of 15 and 20% (MP < DP and DP + SB, P < 0.05). However, the uroliths were small averaging less than 1 mg. In experiment 3, substitution of autoclaved egg albumin for casein, the protein source in experiments 1 and 2, resulted in urine pH of 7.45 and a silica urolith incidence of 46%. An equal-molar mixture of MP and DP providing an added 0.2% phosphorus resulted in a urine pH of 7.07 and reduced the urolith incidence to 4%, and 0.75% of dietary ammonium chloride either with or without the added 0.2% phosphorus gave urine acidification and complete protection from uroliths. Dietary diammonium phosphate also resulted in urine acidification and a 12% urolith incidence. The phosphate and chloride salts used in these studies did not (P > 0.05) increase urine volumes. It is concluded that supplemental dietary phosphorus offers partial protection against silica uroliths that is not associated with increases in urine volume and is only partially dependent on urine acidification. Increases in urolith incidence in rats fed calcium carbonate appear to result from an alkalization of urine and a reduction of urine phosphorus concentration. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The association of a critical reduction in renal mass with the subsequent destruction of remaining nephrons has been observed in several species. We studied this process in experimental rabbits after 1 2 3 nephrectomy to define the course and its pathogenesis in this species. Control rabbits underwent sham operative procedures. After renal ablation, rabbits became increasingly cachectic and developed polyuria and hypertension. Despite food intake similar to that of controls (grams per kilogram per day), experimental rabbits developed severe hypercalcemia by 5 to 8 weeks after renal ablation, a change that persisted until death. During the study 17 experimental animals died of uremia 9 to 27 weeks after surgery, and the remaining seven experimental and 25 sham-operated rabbits were sacrificed at 5 to 7 months. At death, 19 24 experimental rabbits had severe obstruction of their collecting systems by concretions of gravel (n = 3) or large calcium carbonate stones (n = 16). Renal biopsy at 4 weeks revealed focal interstitial round cell infiltration progressing by 12 weeks to diffuse tubulointerstitial inflammation and fibrosis. Histologic evidence of obstruction was also evident at this time and became extensive on all subsequent examinations. By contrast, the glomerull remained well preserved without evidence of sclerosis. We speculate that chronic hypercalcemia and, perhaps more significantly, urinary obstruction may have altered infrared hemodynamics and prevented the development of progressive sclerosis observed in the rat remnant kidney model. The present study describes an experimental model of chronic hypercalcemia and spontaneous calcium carbonate nephrolithiasis. © 1986. © 2014 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Sodium pyruvate, potassium pyruvate, pyruvic acid, sodium bicarbonate and potassium bicarbonate were added to a calcium-oxalate lithogenic diet (a glycolic-acid diet) in order to determine their effects in preventing lithogenicity. Male Wistar-strain rats who had been fed the glycolic-acid diet developed marked urinary calculi within four weeks. Rats in the sodium and potassium pyruvate groups had, however, almost no stones in the urinary system. Rats in the bicarbonate and pyruvic-acid groups showed slightly less effect than those in the pyruvate groups. Urinary oxalate excretion was high in all the groups during the experiment. The urinary oxalate concentration was relatively higher in the sodium-pyruvate group, and significantly higher in the potassium-pyruvate group, than in the glycolic-acid group. Urinary citrate excretion was high both in the pyruvate and bicarbonate groups; the urinary citrate concentration was, however, significantly higher in the pyruvate groups than in the bicarbonate groups at the fourth experimental week. The urinary calcium and magnesium concentrations were irrelevant to the diets administered. Therefore, it can be concluded that pyruvate salts inhibit urinary calculi formation, not by decreasing oxalate synthesis, but by increasing the urinary citrate concentration; bicarbonate salts work in the same manner, but a little less effectively. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - An in vitro model was devised to evaluate the efficacy of the different irrigating solutions utilized for local dissolution of uric acid stones. Tris (hydroxymethyl) aminomethane proved to be several times faster than sodium bicarbonate in dissolving uric acid calculi. The maximal dissolution rate was obtained when the highest pH (10.5) of Tris buffer was used in concentrations at or above 0.2 M. This makes the commercially available THAM-E an optimal choice. Stones averaging 1 cm. in diameter were dissolved in less than 48 hours when this compound was used. Sodium bicarbonate should only be used in solutions with concentrations lower than 0.2 M and pH below 9, if some dissolution is to be attempted. Concentrations and pH's above these levels will coat the stones with hard shells of sodium urate, making it impossible to dissolve them. The in vitro findings were confirmed in vivo in a limited study in pigs with human uric acid calculi surgically placed in their kidneys. Our results indicate how to make the best use of the solutions clinically available in order to obtain total dissolution of uric acid stones in short periods of time. We recommend the use of a 0.3 molar concentration of the buffer (THAM-E) at flow rates of about 50 cc per hour. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Four urinary calculi, derived from Chinese swamp buffalo, were studied by using qualitative chemical analysis, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy and qualitative energy dispersive (electron probe) microanalysis. Qualitative chemical analysis showed that the predominant ions were calcium and carbonate with small amounts of magnesium and ammonium. X-ray diffraction confirmed that the calculi were primarily composed of calcium carbonate (calcite). On ultrastructural examination, three apparently distinct structural regions were identified in the calculi: outer large laminations; cavities containing variable numbers of small spheres and rods; and large spheres. There did not appear to be material that acted as a nidus and all regions, on qualitative electron probe analysis, contained primarily calcium with trace amounts of magnesium, phosphorus, potassium and chloride. It was concluded that calcite calculi in Chinese swamp buffalo are probably formed through a process of asynchronous layering and that nidus formation may not be necessary. Moreover, the ultrastructure of the calcite calculi is similar to that reported for siliceous calculi in ruminants and this suggests that similar factors may be involved in their formation.

AB  - Summary— Thirty‐one calcium stone patients were treated with 300 mg allopurinol daily during a mean follow‐up period of 2 years. They were also given advice on diet and fluid intake. The effects on the recurrence rate of stones were compared with the effects on the recurrence rate in 43 calcium stone patients who were given similar advice on diet and fluid intake but were not treated with allopurinol. In both groups there was a reduction in the recurrence rate but no difference between patients treated with allopurinol and the control group. Some patients with only hyperuricosuria prior to treatment seemed to benefit from allopurinol treatment, whereas those with hypercalciuria continued to form stones with the same frequency. Allopurinol treatment in calcium stone disease appears less effective than treatment with thiazides, magnesium hydroxide or orthophosphate. Copyright © 1985, Wiley Blackwell.

AB  - We describe a condition in rabbits characterized by CaCO<inf>3</inf> crystal accumulation and very high short-circuit current (I(sc)) in the urinary bladder. The incidence of the condition was high in rabbits kept for 2 mo or more in the vivarium. The crystal mass in the bladder increased with age or time until it occupied up to one-third of the bladder volume and occasionally aggregated as stones, and the urine attained a sludgy consistency. In animals with sludgy urine, the urine excreted has a crystal content 20 times lower than that of urine contained in the bladder at time of death, implying retention of crystals in the bladder. Kidney stones were not detected in rabbits with bladder crystals, and bladder crystals were absent in rabbits with kidney stones induced experimentally by uremia. In old rabbits with sludgy urine the I(sc), a measure of Na+ transport, was up to 46 μA/cm2 and averaged 12 μA/cm2, seven times the I(sc) of rabbits with nonsludgy urine. The increased I(sc) was entirely amiloride sensitive. Noise analysis showed it to arise entirely from increased channel density, without change in single-channel current. With one possible exception, we could not find bacterial infection or abnormalities in plasma aldosterone, GFR, or urinary [Na+], [Ca2+], pH, or osmolality that could explain the condition. The exception is that some unidentified component accounting for half the osmolality of nonsludgy urine is absent or at low concentration in sludgy urine. It remains unknown why the condition develops and whether CaCO<inf>3</inf> crystals cause high I(sc) or vice versa or whether both result from a third factor. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Kidney stones in patients with inflammatory bowel disease are usually composed of calcium oxalate. Two factors are important in the increased absorption of dietary oxalate which is responsible for those stone: 1) increased absorption of oxalate in the presence of steatorrhea, and 2) increased permeability of the colon to oxalate. Fortunately, some of the physiologic abnormalities can be corrected. A therapeutic approach is detailed. © Lippincott-Raven Publishers. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Fifteen children with episodes of painless hematuria without calculi and 8 others with calcareous urolithiasis were examined for hypercalciuria. All patients were normocalcemic and excreted excessive amounts of urinary calcium (greater than 4 mg. per kg. per day). A familial history for renal calculi was noted in 8 children with hematuria and in 5 with urolithiasis. Children with hematuria excreted greater amounts of calcium and presented at an earlier age compared to patients with renal calculi. After 7 days of a low calcium diet an oral calcium loading test was performed in children from both groups. Urinary calcium excretion and parathyroid activity were not different in the 2 clinical groups while fasting or after an oral calcium load. Absorptive and renal subtypes were found in patients with hematuria and urolithiasis. Treatment used to prevent the recurrence of calculi also was highly effective in resolving hematuria. Despite differences in age and clinical presentation, these children appeared metabolically similar and responded favorably to therapeutic regimens that reduce urinary calcium excretion. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Increase in the concentration of lithogenic substances above the saturation curve together with alterations in the pH value are the crucial step leading to formation of crystal foci. With regard to the infection stone, whose formation optimum is in the alkaline range of urinary pH, this means that the primary prophylactic measure is acidification of the urine. This can be achieved by various substances, but with great certainty and without side effects by L-methionine. Care must be taken that the urinary pH value is measured three times a day by the patients, since it is subject to a circadian rhythm. The acidification must be carried out consistently to values between 5.8 and 6.2, as this is the pH level at which there is less danger that phosphate or ammonium urate crystals occur. Besides the central prophylactic measure (acidification), adjuvant measures are necessary, consisting of checking the urine for freedom from infection and reduction of phosphate excretion with the urine. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Certain types of pyeloureteral calculi can be treated by chemolytic drug irrigation through a percutaneous nephrostomy catheter. Struvite, apatite, and carbonate stones can be dissolved with an acidic solution (hemacidrin, Suby solution G). An alkaline agent (Tham-E®, acetylcysteine) will dissolve cystine calculi. While most uric acid stones are managed by oral alkalinization with sodium bicarbonate or potassium citrate, there are occasions (cardiac, metabolic conditions) where treatment via percutaneous nephrostomy is preferable. Successful nonoperative management of symptomatic calculi has been obtained in 85% of cases with chemolysis of more than 150 stones. © 1984 Springer-Verlag New York Berlin Heidelberg Tokyo. © 2010 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Advances in renal lithiasis research have contributed to a better understanding of the many varied factors that contribute to renal calculus formation. Utilizing the newer techniques of ambulatory metabolic evaluation, we can establish a specific diagnosis in 95% of recurrent stone-formers. Since a significant percentage of initial stone for mers will never have a second episode, it is essential to establish the natural history of the patient's stone disease prior to initiating potentially life-long medical therapy. The majority of initial stone-formers can be managed with education concerning modest dietary restrictions and increased fluid intake. For the recurrent stone-former with metabolically active stone disease, it is probably best to design medical therapy to treat the specific urinary chemical abnormality or disease process. © 1984 Springer-Verlag New York Berlin Heidelberg Tokyo. © 2010 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Human saliva, pancreatic juice and urine are usually surpersaturated with respect to calcium phosphate, calcium carbonate and calcium oxalate, respectively. The potential precipitation of these salts is prevented by unusual phosphoproteins which are normally present in these biological fluids. In vitro, such phosphoproteins are able to suppress the crystal growth of calcium salts; their physiological level is high enough to fulfill this function in vivo. The main molecular characteristics of these phosphoproteins are described and their biological function, as crystallization inhibitors, are discussed by the authors. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The occurrence of silicon dioxide in human urinary calculi is more common than generally believed. During a 3 year study the authors analyzed about 750 human urinary calculi using the scanning electron microscope and x-ray crystallographic methods. Silicon dioxide of the alpha quartz variety was found to be the principal constituent in calculi from 5 male patients. Some of the patients were recurrent stone formers and one patient had previously produced a silicon dioxide calculus. In none of the 5 cases was there any history of gastric disorders or of any ingestion of antacids in the form of magnesium trisilicate. Some of the silica particles had a morphology typical of glacial sand. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Urolithiasis is one of the most common diseases and its incidence has increased considerably during the past decade. If the cause of lithiasis is not eliminated, a relapse is likely to occur in approx. 50% of patients suffering from this disease. The rate of relapse may be reduced to approx. 10%, if the appropriate preventive measures are taken. X-ray examination is still considered to be the most valuable tool in the diagnosis of urolithiasis. Sonography appears to improve diagnostic accuracy, in particular in pregnant patients and in the presence of stones which are not radio-opaque. In the field of stone removal major advances were made due to extracorporal shock wave lithotripsy, percutaneous nephroscopy as well as ureterorenoscopy. In patients showing obstruction of the urinary tract or a coral calculus surgical treatment continues to be the method of choice. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - We studied the effect of calcium deprivation and loading in 17 healthy subjects and 76 patients with renal calculi. Five had primary hyperparathyroidism with an elevated plasma ionised calcium and detectable plasma parathyroid hormone. Forty-nine had idiopathic hypercalciuria, defined by a urine calcium greater than 7 mmol/day on a free diet. Twenty-two were normocalciuric. Fasting plasma calcium, corrected for albumin, was higher in the patients with idiopathic hypercalciuria (2.40 ± 0.10 mmol/l) than in controls (2.28 ± 0.05 mmol/l, p < 0.005). Plasma calcium was intermediate in the normocalciuric stone formers (2.35 ± 0.08 mmol/l) and elevated in the patients with primary hyperparathyroidism (2.62 ± 0.07 mmol/l). Nephrogenous cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and parathyroid hormone levels were highest in the primary hyperparathyroid group and did not differ significantly within the other groups. Nephrogenous cAMP correlated positively with plasma calcium in the patients with primary hyperparathyroidism and negatively in controls; there was no correlation in the idiopathic hypercalciuria group. Following an oral calcium load, plasma calcium rose and nephrogenous cAMP fell similarly in all groups. Fasting urinary calcium and its increase after load were greatest in the idiopathic hypercalciuria and primary hyperparathyroid groups, with intermediate results in the normocalciuric patients. Neither the initial metabolic patterns nor the response to thiazide fitted with the previously described patterns of absorptive and renal hypercalciuria. Increased parathyroid gland activity is the most probable cause of idiopathic hypercalciuria. © 2004 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.; Medline is the source for the MeSH terms of this document.

AB  - Silica calculi in man are extremely rare; only 12 cases have been reported. In an electron microscopic study of human urinary stones, siliceous deposits were encountered in three out of 180 stones as a discrete component of stones. There were no histories of magnesium trisilicate administration in these cases. Morphology of the deposits was distinctive from any other components of the stones and bore some resemblance to animal silica calculi. Siliceous deposits in human urinary stones appear to be more common than generally recognized. © 1983 Springer-Verlag. © 2007 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - A recently described method for analysis of inorganic pyrophosphate (PP<inf>i</inf>) was used to investigate urinary excretion of PP<inf>i</inf> in renal calcium stone formers with normal (n=44) or impaired renal acidification capacity (RTA; n=13) as well as in controls (n=22) of corresponding sex and age. The mean values of the 24 h urinary PP<inf>i</inf> excretion were lower in stone-forming groups than in the control group. There was no statistical difference in the mean 24-h PP<inf>i</inf> excretion between stone-forming groups with normal and with defective urinary acidification, but there was an overrepresentation of low values for PP<inf>i</inf> excretion in the latter subject group. Positive relationships existed in all subject groups between the urinary excretion of phosphate and PP<inf>i</inf> when pooled data from various conditions of phosphate intake (fasting, non-fasting, oral phosphate loading) were examined. In the fasting state the PP<inf>i</inf> excretion was similar in stone formers and controls. Oral orthophosphate loading after phosphate deprivation with aluminium hydroxide invariably caused a rise in urinary PP<inf>i</inf> excretion in all subjects, with no difference between stone formers with normal acidification, RTA stone patients and controls. The increment in urinary PP<inf>i</inf> was positively correlated to the increment in urinary phosphate but not to changes in serum phosphate. In conclusion, these results suggest that renal stone formers may have a lower daily PP<inf>i</inf> excretion compared with controls. This was most pronounced in patients with impaired renal acidification capacity and may be due to a generalized disturbed tubular function. © 1983 Springer-Verlag. © 2007 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - All urinary calculi should be thoroughly examined. Among 2,000 calculi analyzed by infra-red spectrophotometry, some were found to contain rare constituants and drugs which might be held responsible for urinary stone formation. These included glafenine, triamterene, co-trimoxazole, sulphaguanidine, allopurinol, phenazopyridine, flumequine and anti-acid powders containing aluminium, calcium and magnesium trisilicates and/or carbonates or bicarbonates. Considering that these drugs are widely used, the incidence of drug-induced urinary calculi appears to be very low. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Effects of Selected Therapeutic Agents on Urolithiasis Induced by Terephthalic Acid in the Male Weanling Fischer 344 Rat. Wolkowski-Tyl, R. and Chin, T.Y. (1983).Fundam. Appl. Toxicol. 3:552-558. Exposure of male weanling Fischer 344 rats to 4.0% terephthalic acid (TPA) in the diet (positive controls) for two weeks (postnatal days 28-42) resulted in a 50% incidence of bladder calculi, aciduria, elevated urinary excretion of calcium (Ca) and magnesium (Mg), and slightly elevated serum levels of Ca and Mg relative to negative controls. Possible mechanisms of TPA-induced urolithiasis were examined by daily oral administration of allopurinol, chlorothiazide, or neutral phosphates, at their recommended therapeutic doses during exposure to dietary 4.0% TPA. An additional group was fed 4.0% TPA and 4.0% sodium bicarbonate in the diet for two weeks. Chlorothiazide or dietary bicarbonate abolished TPA-induced urolithiasis, but allopurinol and neutral phosphates had no effect. Bicarbonate increased water intake above that of positive controls and ameliorated the TPA-induced aciduria. It also increased urinary Mg and TPA above positive control values. Chlorothiazide reduced urinary Ca and TPA levels below those of positive controls. Treatment with chlorothiazide, neutral phosphates or bicarbonate slightly reduced serum Ca below the levels in either positive or negative controls. Drug treatment did not alter TPA-induced elevated serum Mg levels, but bicarbonate reduced serum Mg levels to negative control values. In conclusion, TPA-induced urolithiasis in male weanling rats was abolished by therapeutic agents which reduced urinary Ca and TPA excretion (chlorothiazide), or which enhanced water intake, urinary Mg and TPA excretion, and ameliorated TPA-induced aciduria (dietary bicarbonate). These factors appear to be critical for TPA-induced urolithiasis. © 1983 Copyright 1983, Society of Toxicology. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Side effects of antacid therapy are dose dependent and compound related. High dose antacid intake may lead to fluid retention in the body depending on the sodium content of the different antacid preparations. Sodium dicarbonate ingestion provokes metabolic alkalosis and alkaliuria, the 'nonsystemic calcium and magnesium containing antacids' cause these changes too, but to a lower degree. Urinary pH elevation favours the precipitation of calcium and magnesium salts, predisposing to renal stone formation. In patients with renal insufficiency the calcium and magnesium absorption may lead rapidly to toxic serum concentrations. Calcium and magnesium containing acids may provoke an acid rebound, which is clinically not relevant following magnesium-hydroxide-ingestion. Phosphorus depletion is an important side effect of aluminum hydroxide intake. The phosphorus depletion syndrome combined with skeletal demineralisation and osteomalacia may occur. As well as calcium and magnesium cations the tribasic aluminum will be absorbed from the gut in small amounts. In patients with renal insufficiency aluminum deposition in the brain grey matter following Al(OH)<inf>3</inf> ingestion will occur and seems to be a co-factor for the development of a dialysis encephalopathy syndrome. The clinical relevance of aluminum absorption from gut in patients with normal renal function is unknown until now. © 2004 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.; Medline is the source for the MeSH terms of this document.

AB  - A patient with sarcoidosis and chronic renal failure was treated for hyperphosphatemia with aluminum hydroxide. The subsequent fall in serum phosphorus was followed by the development of hypercalcemia and nephrolithiasis. Corticosteroid therapy normalized the serum calcium and halted the progression of the nephrolithiasis, but did not improve renal function. Hyperphosphatemia may have blocked the expression of sarcoid hypercalcemia in the patient. The mechanism is unclear but inhibition of the synthesis or action of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D may have been involved. Reduction of serum phosphorus may lead to severe hypercalcemia in some patients with sarcoidosis. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - During a 5 year period, 500 stones from the upper urinary tract and 100 from the urinary bladder of as many unselected and consecutive patients were obtained in one hospital and analysed crystallographically. 90.4% of the upper urinary tract stones and 65 % of the bladder stones belonged to the groups of calcium stones, while 6.6% and 24%, respectively, were triple phosphate stones. The contribution of calcium stones to this material is higher and that of triple phosphate stones lower than in comparable materials. Frequency variations between materials also exist within the groups of calcium stones, and for uric acid, urate and cystine stones. On the basis of published material, it is not possible to say if these differences are real or reflect variations in the selection of stones and the methods of analysis. Reports on stone materials should include information on these aspects in order to allow meaningful comparison. Distinction between stones from the upper urinary tract and from the bladder is mandatory. The composition pattern reported here is believed to be as representative as is possible to obtain. A major part of stones from the upper urinary tract is, however, lost for analysis following spontaneous passage. Such stones are more often pure calcium oxalate and less often triple phosphate stones than those which are obtained by surgical methods, and the extent to which they are obtained will influence the findings in stone materials. © 1983, Informa UK Ltd.

AB  - The urine to blood carbon dioxide tension gradient (U-B P(CO<inf>2</inf>)) following alkalinization of the urine (pH = 7.8) has been widely used to assess distal tubular hydrogen secretion. The magnitude of the U-B P(CO2) is influenced not only by the rate of hydrogen secretion but also by bicarbonate concentration and water abstraction. Simultaneous administration of sodium bicarbonate and dDAVP improve the reliability of the test in healthy children. Children with distal renal tubular acidosis were not able to increase urinary P(CO2, while a normal increase was found in patients with proximal renal tubular acidosis and the Fanconi Syndrome. Four out of nine patients with urolithiasis failed to increase urinary P(CO<inf>2</inf>) following NaHCO<inf>3</inf> and dDAVP-administration, despite a normal ability to acidify the urine following NH<inf>4</inf>Cl administration. To assess the effect of acute alterations in urinary concentration on urinary P(CO<inf>2</inf>), the test was carried out in children with central diabetes insipidus. Despite sharp increase in urinary bicarbonate concentration these patients failed to increase urinary P(CO<inf>2</inf>). © 2004 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.; Medline is the source for the MeSH terms of this document.

AB  - 175 stones from 70 recurrent stone formers with each at least two stones available for analysis were studied crystallographically. The chance that a subsequent stone belonged to the same of five major stone groups was 65% but rose to 91 % if three of these groups were considered as one (calcium stones). Other findings, however, indicate that distinction between the three groups of calcium stones is of interest. Thus, pure calcium oxalate stones (Ox) did not occur in the same patients as pure calcium phosphate stones (P). In comparable stones containing both the above types of components (OxP), the calcium phosphate content was significantly lower (average apatite content per stone 9%) in stones from patients who also had Ox stones than (37%) in those who had associated P stones. Also, the stone nucleus was frequently Ox in the OxP stones from the former and usually P in the OxP stones of the latter patients. Brushite occurred in 10% of the stones, which is more frequent than in unselected stone materials and largely due to a tendency for it to recur in a few patients. Patients who provide more than one stone for analysis appear to differ considerably in stone composition from stone patients in general, and inclusion of several stones from some patients will lead to bias in materials purporting to reflect stone composition in a population. When available, several stones from each patient should preferably be analysed. Exceptions may be made for cystine and, possibly, pure uric acid stone patients. © 1983, Informa UK Ltd.

AB  - The influence of calcium carbonate, aluminium oxyhydrate (Andursil®) and an anion exchanger (Colestid®) on the absorption of oxalate from the intestine in rats was investigated. The animals were administered daily doses of 15mg oxalate as a 14C-sodium-oxalate solution by means of a throat probe, and the substances of interest were mixed with the food. The intake of food and the 14C-activity in the urine were measured during four urine-collecting periods of 3 days each. The quantity of the enterally administered oxalate excreted with urine has a negative correlation to the amount of the investigated test substances ingested with food. © 1982 Springer-Verlag. © 2007 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Antacid ingestion may lead to side-effects related to their chemical composition. Aluminium hydroxide may cause the phosphate depletion syndrome even during short-term administration of high doses in patients at high risk, such as alcoholics. Long-term intake may lead to bone demineralization and to osteomalacia. Fluoride complexing in the gut and prevention of fluoride absorption may be an additional factor. The clinical relevance of aluminium absorption in patients with normal renal function is not clear. In contrast, in patients with renal failure, aluminium hydroxide ingestion may contribute to an increasing hyperaluminemia. Hyperaluminemia and tissue deposition of aluminium in these patients may contribute to the dialysis-associated encephalopathy. Magnesium hydroxide causes an alkalinization of the urine due to magnesium absorption and urinary excretion. Thus, in renal insufficiency, a life-threatening hypermagnesemia may develop if magnesium-aluminium-containing antacids are prescribed. The milk-alkali syndrome, rarely observed nowadays, may be caused by calcium carbonate- and sodium bicarbonate-containing antacids. Hypercalciuria and alkaluria predispose to nephrolithiasis. The possibility that these disturbances in mineral metabolism will develop in patients with normal renal function is unlikely unless there is an abuse of these 'over the counter' antacids. © 2004 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Magnesium is a known inhibitor of the formation of calcium oxalate crystals in the urine and was proposed for prophylactic treatment in renal stone disease as early as the 17th and 18th centuries. We have treated 55 patients with recurrent renal calcium stone disease without signs of magnesium deficiency (normal serum magnesium, urinary magnesium, intracellular magnesium in muscle biopsies, gastrointestinal absorption of 28Mg, and magnesium loading test) from our outpatient stone clinic for up to four years with 500 mg Mg", in the form of Mg(OH)2, daily. The mean stone episode rate before therapy was 0.8 stones/year/patient. Forty-three recurrent renal calcium stone-formers without medical therapy served as controls. Serum magnesium increased initially but after one year returned to the pretreatment level. Urinary magnesium excretion increased promptly and remained elevated during the follow-up period. The urinary calcium excretion remained unchanged. The magnesium/ calcium ratio in the urine increased and approached a value earlier found in healthy subjects without stone disease. Urinary citrate increased on therapy when analysed after three years of treatment. The mean stone episode rate decreased from 0.8 to 0.08 stones/year on treatment and 85 Vo of the patients remained free of recurrence during follow-up, whereas 59Vo of the patients in the control group continued their stone formation. Side effects were few. Magnesium treatment in renal calcium stone disease is effective with few side effects. No clinical signs of magnesium excess were observed. © 1982 Alan R.

AB  - Various stones were examined by a combined electron microscopy. Morphological parameters of calcium oxalates and phosphates, struvite, urates, cystine, gypsum, siliceous deposits in urinary, prostatic and salivary calculi, and calcium carbonate in gallstones were defined. Study also disclosed that stones frequently contain organic crystals in addition to the organic matrix. Membranous cell debris was observed in the nuclei of small stones and were believed to be common nidus of various stones. In view of a very limited number of crystals occurring in human stones, which differ obviously in their habits and growth patterns, an expeditious identification of stone components is possible by scanning electron microscopy. SEM with x-ray analysis is a powerful tool for research and diagnosis of various stones. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The renal handling of urate was investigated in 28 recurrent calcium stone formers and 12 healthy controls. 12 patients were hyperuricosuric and 16 patients had incomplete proximal or distal acidification defects. Measurements of the glomerular filtration and the tubular reabsorption of filtered urate were made through the pyrazinamide (PZA)-suppression test of urate secretion. Hyperuricosuria could not be explained by defects in the renal handling of urate. Patients with proximal acidification defects had a higher tubular reabsorption of filtered urate than the other subjects. Tubular reabsorption of filtered urate was inversely correlated, and filtered urate escaping reabsorption positively correlated to the 24-hour excretion of urate. In contrast, the PZA-suppressible fraction of urate excretion, which is the net effect of tubular secretion and post-secretory reabsorption and thought to be the main regulator of urate excretion, was not correlated to the 24-hour excretion of urate. It is concluded that the renal handling of urate is basically normal in calcium stone disease, whereas minor deviations may co-exist with renal tubular acidification dysfunction. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - During the last 10-15 years urolithiasis has come into a more successful stage. Nowadays lithotripsy by massive wave therapy is a ray of hope, which is unfortunately still in the initial stage (Austrian and Bavarian Congress of Urologists Munich 24 April 1980, report Schmiedt et al., Munich). On the basis of larger secondary examinations by choice we know that neither the observation of a special diet nor focal sanations or mineral water cures and general preventive or other measures, respectively, with the exception of directed chemotherapy are able to render a significant frequency of recidivations. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Epidemiology: The annual incidence of urolithiasis in the population is at least 0.1%. In rural areas, there are remarkably less actual stone formers than in urban districts, and also vegetarians show less stone disease. Calcium carbonate as urinary calculus compound is not in the strict sense impossible, but often an artifact. About 10% of homocygotic cystinuria patients never suffer an actual stone disease. Pathogenesis: It is obvious that for stone formation urinary supersaturation alone is not sufficient. Besides the well-known inhibitors like citrate, magnesium and pyrophosphate there have to be other important urinary constituents. Risk factors are high protein or glucose intakes and, in general, hyperalimentation, simply because any food has to be deplenished somehow and increases the urine concentration. A special cause may be found in alterations of the renal tubuli. Diagnostic: For the quite difficult oxalate analysis, an enzymatic test is commercially available. Up to now, the most important analytical task in urolithiasis is still the correct analysis of urinary calculi. Qualitative chemical analysis shows up to 50% erroneous results, leading to false therapies. To determine the calculus compounds the best appropriate method is by far the X-ray diffraction analysis. Therapy: The results with adsorption medicines are contradictory. Satisfactory therapies are given for uricosuria with allopurinol and for oxaluria with pyridoxine. A new therapy for cystinuria may be the combined application of ascorbic acid and sodium hydrogen carbonate. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Experimental studies in 10 paraplegic patients showed highly significant reduction in urinary saturation associated with the oral administration of aluminium hydroxide. Only 50 per cent of urine samples from five patients with calculous disease were actually undersaturated, however. During clinical studies in 12 patients with renal calculous disease, four had recurrence or growth of calculi while receiving medication, three had no recurrence during therapy, but new stones appeared after the medication was stopped, and five had no growth or recurrence either during therapy or after its cessation. © 1981, International Spinal Cord Society.

AB  - Hyperabsorption of dietary oxalate is a major factor in the pathogenesis of enteric hyperoxaluria and a frequent complication of inflammatory bowel disease and ileojejunal bypass surgery. Successful treatment requires reduction in oxalate intake or inhibition of absorption of dietary oxalate by oral ingestion of oxalate binding agents. To identify such agents, oxalate binding by anion‐exchange resins, gums, and aluminum hydroxide was measured under conditions that simulated those present in the intestinal lumen. Of the agents tested, those that bound oxalate best were colestipol and aluminum hydroxide. Strongly basic anion‐exchange resins readily bound oxalate only in the absence of chloride. These results suggest that colestipol and aluminum hydroxide administration might reduce dietary oxalate absorption in patients with enteric hyperoxaluria.

AB  - The authors briefly describe 2 studies, one in vitro and the other in vivo which show how magnesium can be of value as an inhibitor of calcium oxalate crystallisation. Although other authors have disputed the use of magnesium as a therapeutic agent of this type the present authors have used magnesium trisilicate to treat oxalic lithiasis in man (300 mg/day). This has been combined with the administration of neutral phosphate (1.2 to 3 g/day) and of succinamide (9 to 12 g/day). The results of this therapy are better than have ever been obtained before. Although it is true that there are still failures - and it is difficult to say how many - in 3 cases the calculi have completely dissolved and in another 5 partial litholysis has been achieved.

AB  - Prophylactic treatment with magnesium hydroxide was instituted in 56 consecutive cases with renal calcium stones. The patients had been investigated previously with regard to the magnesium metabolism. The urinary magnesium excretion increased promptly and remained on a higher level during treatment. No changes were observed in the serum or urinary calcium concentrations. Most patients have undergone treatment for at least 2 years and 45 have been free of recurrences or formations of new stones. The mean stone episode rate during treatment was 0.03 stones per year compared to 0.8 stones per year before treatment was instituted. The natural history of stone disease also was followed in 34 patients with stones who had received no prophylactic therapy and 15 have experienced recurrences after 2 years. Therefore, in comparison, treatment with magnesium hydroxide appeared to reduce the recurrence rate. Apart from minor gastrointestinal discomfort no adverse effects were observed during treatment. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - 11 patients with kidney stone disease and idiopathic hypercalciuria (urinary calcium above 4 mg/kg/j), without phosphorus renal leak and 6 control subjects were put for 3 days on a diet containing 1 g calcium and 1 phosphorus daily (period A), and then for 4 days on a diet containing 1 g calcium, 450 mg phosphorus and 3 g aluminium hydroxide daily (period B). During period A, no significant difference in blood calcium, phosphorus and magnesium, phosphaturia, rate of phosphorus reabsorption (RPR) and ratio maximum RPR/creatinine clearance was found between the two groups. After 2 days on a low phosphate diet (period B) the blood phosphorus decreased significantly in the hypercalciuric patients thus revealing a latent abnormality in the retention of phosphates in them. This abnormality could play an important role in the pathogenesis of hypercalciuria. © 2012 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.; MEDLINE® is the source for the MeSH terms of this document.

AB  - This report deals with the investigation of renal crystallosis in the autopsy tissue of a fatal human case of ethylene glycol poisoning. A previously healthy 22-year-old man consumed about one liter of Prestone antifreeze, which contains 95% by weight of ethylene glycol. He died in coma 48 h later with clinical evidence of metabolic acidosis and renal shutdown. Postmortem histological examination showed abundant crystallosis of the renal tubules. Polarization microscopy demonstrated brilliant birefringence of the crystals. In addition to the tubular crystallosis, scanning electron microscopy showed crystalline particles within the glomeruli as well. Energy dispersive X-ray analysis of the crystals gave a strong calcium signal. The crystals were demonstrated by means of conventional and high-voltage electron microscopy. Electron diffraction gave several hexagonal patterns of calcium carbonate-calcite and a tetragonal pattern suggestive of calcium oxalate monohydrate. X-ray diffraction of the crystals separated from the kidney showed the presence of calcium carbonate and calcium oxalate monohydrate as the major constituents. © 2004 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.; Medline is the source for the MeSH terms of this document.

AB  - In recent years more insight has been gained into the increased incidence of nephrolithiasis in gastroenterological disease. Oxalate calculi, the result of hyperoxaluria are encountered especially in pathology of the small intestine such as Crohn's disease and patients subjected to ileal resection. The hyperoxaluria is due to increased absorption of oxalic acid from the intestine. Hyperabsorption of oxalic acid from the intestine may be brought about by reduction of the intraluminal calcium concentration or increase of the permeability of the mucosa of the large intestine. Unlike primary hyperoxaluria, 'enteric' hyperoxaluria may be influenced favorably by the following therapeutic measures: reduction of the intake of oxalic acid; reduction of the intake of lipids (substitution of medium-chain triglycerides); cholestyramine; AL(OH)<inf>3</inf>-containing antacid preparations(?); and oral administration of calcium. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - A 2 1/4 year-old boy was treated for cystinuria and urolithiasis with high fluid intake, sodium bicarbonate and D-penicillamine, over a period of 5 3/4 years, including unauthorized interruptions and prescribed pauses. Therapy was partially successful but regrowth of calculi coincided with interruptions of D-penicillamine administration and also with the institution of a low-dose D-penicillamine regime. Flat feet, scoliosis, pectus carinatum, hypermobility of joints, molluscoid pseudotumors and atrophic scars were alarming side effects of D-penicillamine. However, the possibility was not excluded that a forme fruste of an Ehlers-Danlos syndrome preexisted in this boy and was effected by D-penicillamine. Only the molluscoid pseudotumors regressed when D-penicillamine was reduced or omitted temporarily. Osteolathyrism caused by D-penicillamine has been hitherto unreported in man. © 2004 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.; Medline is the source for the MeSH terms of this document.

AB  - Low levels of red blood cell (RBC) carbonic anhydrase (CA) activity in hemoglobin-free hemolyzate (HFH) were found in 2 children with nephrolithiasis when compared to age-matched controls. The lowest levels were consistently found over a two year period in a 6 1/2 year old boy (U.P.) whose renal calculi contained uric acid, ammonia, calcium carbonate and oxalate. His RBC CA values ranged from 1.4-2.7 U/gHb compared with levels of 3.9-5.3 U/g Hb in control subjects. Statistical comparisons of the mean values for U.P., 2.06 U/g Hb, and his age-matched control subjects, 4.46 U/g Hb, revealed a significant difference (P = <0.001). Similar reductions in RBC CA activity were found in his father- 2.0 and 2.1 U/g Hb compared with 3.3 and 3.9 U/g Hb in adult controls. HFH CA activity was not decreased in the mother or sister. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of HFH from 4 of the children and the father of U.P. was abnormal. However, this abnormal electrophoretic pattern could only be demonstrated when the gel was run for 120 minutes and not when it was run for 80 or 160 minutes. We have identified a patient and his father with low levels of RBC CA activity. © 2004 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.; Medline is the source for the MeSH terms of this document.

AB  - A case of milk of calcium renal stone was reported. It is an unusual condition in which there is suspension of calcium salt within a pyelogenic cyst. The diagnosis is difficult because of its rarity. Reviewing literature, plain abdominal X-ray in different positions were emphasized. We found that fluoroscopy with spot films in different positions is worth-while. It has to be differentiated from gallstone and also from usual renal stone. Conservative treatment is advised if there is no suggestive malignancy. © 1978 The Japan Surgical Society. © 2008 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Weddellite (calcium oxalate dihydrate) and calcite (anhydrous calcium carbonate phase) are components of concretions in the renal sac of the ascidian tunicate Molgula manhattensis. The presence of weddellite along with urate in the concretions suggests a resemblance to human kidney stones, although, unlike the latter, the concretions in Molgula do not seem to be pathologic deposits.

AB  - Milk of calcium is a liquid or semisolid suspension of calcium salts. Chemical analyses of previous cases have shown that these can be calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate (hydroxyapatite) or calcium oxalate. A case is presented of calcification in the lumen of the urinary tract in a seven year old boy hospitalised for severe burns. Complaint of abdominal pain led to a radiograph which showed a 3 cm long calcification in the left lower ureter. He was obliguric the following day, and suddenly passed a 3 mm triangular calculus followed by a diuresis of 2.7 l of clear dilute urine. Crystalline products persisted in the urine, and left kidney function as assessed by intravenous pyelography was affected for several days. A follow-up intravenous pyelogram one week later was normal. Four previous cases of what is assumed to be milk of calcium in the ureter have been described, and the ureter was obstructed in all but one. The etiology of calcification in the present case is unknown, but may be related to lack of ambulation in a previously active child. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Milk-of-calcium stone is a rare finding in the kidney. It is diagnosed radiologically based on the fact that the opacity takes a semilunar shape and layers according to the position of the patient. An unusual observation is that layering may require some time to take place and that the semilunar configuration may be found incidentally in the supine position as well. © 1978. © 2014 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - A large calculus developed in a renal transplant patient and was removed by pyelolithotomy. Hyperparathyroidism was not present. Important factors to consider before performing a nephrolithotomy in a transplanted kidney are whether the transplant was a right or left kidney and the timing of the operation in relation to renal function and infection. The etiology for renal stone formation in renal transplant recipients includes hypercalciuria, renal tubular acidosis, antacid administration and infection. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The present study was undertaken to determine if urinary protein can produce urinary stones and what types of protein have such an effect. Normal human serum was fractionated first with ammonium sulfate and then with DEAE-cellulose. The stone- forming action of each fraction was estimated by calculating their ability to alter the sedimentation rate and ζ-potential of a calcium carbonate suspension. Finally, the proteins in each fraction were identified by cellulose acetate electrophoresis. The most marked aggregating and precipitating effect on a CaCO<inf>3</inf> suspension was observed with a mixture of proteins of α<inf>1</inf>-globulin and albumin fractions. However, β- and γ-fractions had little aggregating effect on the CaCO<inf>3</inf> suspension. © 1977 S. Karger AG, Basel. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Two hundred patients suffering from peptic ulcer have been examined for urinary stones. Two hundred healthy controls have been similarly studied. In 14 patients from the first group (7%) urinary calculi were found, whereas the percentage in the second group was only 1%. This difference is statistically significant (P < 0.01) (χ2 distribution test). The increased incidence of peptic ulcer was attributed to the consumption of calcium in combination with easily absorbable alkalis (sodium bicarbonate). These findings must be considered in therapy for peptic ulcer diathesis. Copyright © 1977, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - This study deals with the role of the stone matrix substance in formation of urinary stones. A series of coagulation experiments were conducted by determining the sedimentation rate of calcium carbonate suspension with respect to the following substances: sodium alginate, stone matrix substance, bovine albumin and chondroitin sulfate C, these were each added to a separate fine particle suspension of calcium carbonate. Changes in ζ-potential of the suspension particles after addition of the above materials were determined microscopically using Usui’s method. The results obtained in this study indicate that sodium alginate, the matrix substance, bovine albumin and chondroitin sulfate C act on the suspension particles, and as a result, coagulation is produced by a decrease of the ζ-potential of the particles. Application of kinetic energy to the coagulate caused by sodium alginate resulted in the formation of a solid. From these results it is considered that the matrix substance is not incorporated by accident in urinary stones, but it participates in the formation of them. © 1976 S.

AB  - Any patient presenting with renal colic requires the taking of a detailed history with inquiries about diet and drugs, an examination of the urine, intravenous pyelography and measurement of the calcium concentration in serum and urine. Any stone passed should be analysed. Recurrent stone formation warrants more comprehensive metabolic investigation. The cause of renal calculi in most patients is still not known. When a cause is found, specific treatment can prevent or control stone formation. For the majority in whom no abnormality is detected, various methods of reducing stone formation have been tried but results are disappointing. The most important points in management are the early detection and effective treatment of urinary tract infection or obstruction and the maintenance of a high fluid intake. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Several species of bacteria from the family Enterobacteriaceae formed crystalline materials containing calcium when grown in a defined culture medium. Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus vulgaris, Citrobacter freundii, and C. intermedius produced calcium pyrophosphate crystals. Edwardsiella tarda and Escherichia coli formed calcite III crystals, whereas Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Providencia stuartii, and Serratia marcescens produced hydroxyapatite crystals. Several of these bacteria have been isolated from the kidneys of patients with kidney stones indicating that microorganisms may be involved in the enucleation process of kidney stone formation. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Vesical or renal stones of ammonio magnesium phosphate and calcium carbonate were found in 8 (7.6%) of 104 patients with spinal cord lesions. Contributing factors were urinary infection, prolonged immobilization, urinary stasis, foreign bodies in the urinary tract, decrease or loss of vesical antibacterial action, insufficient fluid intake, alkalinity of urine, psychological stress and existing renal and vesical lithiasis. Lithiasis can be prevented in these patients by increased fluid intake (leading to over 2 litres of urine a day), acidifying urine (preventing crystallization of phosphates), adequate posture, early passive mobilization, intermittent catheterization (or, if necessary, regular vesical lavage with permanent catheter), early treatment of infections or lithiasis. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Fourteen pancreatic calculi from the corresponding number of pancreatic lithiasis patients were examined mineralogically and histochemically. The following results were obtained. The main components of calculi were calcium carbonate in 13 of the 14 cases, and calcium phosphate in the remaining one. Calcium carbonate calculi were all so-called intraductal calculi, with acidic glycoprotein apparently enwrapping the component particles. Acidic glycoproteins acted to bridge calcium carbonate particles, as in the cases of gallstone and urinary stone. The calcium phosphate calculus had a histochemical feature of pathologic calcification with degenerated collagen fibrils as the matrix, suggesting the calcification of the fibrotic pancreatic parenchyma after pancreatitis. © 1975, Tohoku University Medical Press.

AB  - A suspension of chalk powder was injected into the cavity of the urinary bladder of Fischer 344 rats. Three weeks later rats were divided into 4 major groups and were given a submucosal injection. One group received a suspension of viable Chapman 4909 tumor cells, the 2nd group received a suspension of frozen-killed 4909 tumor cells, the 3rd group received a suspension of normal rat spleen cells, and the 4th group received cell-free fresh tissue culture medium. After 3 additional weeks urolithiasis was recognized in each experimental group. The incidence of calculi in the groups as listed above was 14 of 17, 6 of 11, 6 of 11, and 2 of 15, respectively. in control studies inocula consisted of tumor alone, i.e., without chalk powder. Inoculation of the 4909 rat bladder cancer cell line into the lumen of urinary bladders of rats did not result in any calculi after 3 weeks but did produce intramural tumor nodules and hyperplastic changes in adjacent host urothelium in 2 of 10 rats. The tumor inoculated in the submucosa of the bladder produced calculi and papillomas in 2 of 7 rats, and it produced intramural tumor nodules with adjacent hyperplasia of urothelium in all 7 rats. Over 90% of the rats with large urinary stones, i.e., 35 mg or more, had urothelial changes consisting of both hyperplasia and papillomatosis. For the rats with calculi smaller than 35 mg/rat, hyperplasia was seen in only 25% and no papillomas were observed. These observations indicate that in the Fischer 344 male rat the formation of calculi in the urinary bladder in association with particles of chalk powder is enhanced by manipulation of the submucosa of the bladder wall by a number of materials. Large calculi themselves, in the absence of neoplastic cells, stimulate the formation of papillomas. © 1975, American Association for Cancer Research.

AB  - Phenacetin abuse is linked with papillary necrosis, induction of renal pelvis carcinoma and urinary bladder cancer. Antibiotics, sulphonamides, antituberculous drugs, antipyretics, antihistaminic drugs, hypnotics, digitalis may cause allergic reactions of the urinary epithelium. Antitumour chemotherapy and oral iodine can cause massive urinary bladder haemorrhage. Surgical chemical litholysis can harm the urinary tract (necroses, infection, haematuria). Chloramphenicol, tetracycline, penicillin, sulphonamides, methenamine, isoniazid, para amino salicylic acid, piperazine, aminophenazone, acetylsalicylic acid, phenylbutazone, oestrogens, chlorothiazide, chlorpromazine, anticoagulants and hydantoin can cause heamaturia. Antitumour chemotherapy, uricosuric drugs, steroids, vitamin D intoxication, dihydrotachysterol, laxative abuse, stone prevention errors, sulphonamides, ampicillin, phenacetin, para amino salicylic acid and nitrofurantoin can lead to urinary stone formation. Urinary bladder dysfunction may be caused by parasympatholytic drugs, opiates, spasmolytic drugs, antihistaminic drugs, barbiturates, diazepam, chlorpromazine, perphenazine, thioridazine, imipramine iproniazid. Retroperitoneal fibrosis can be caused by ergot or lysergic acid derivatives, antihistaminic drugs, phenacetin, atropine like substances and hydralazine. Hydantoinates may lead to retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy. Serious complications (obstruction or compression of ureter, massive haematuria, suspected tumour) require immediate urologic treatment; they can often be prevented (e.g. reduced drug administration, increased diuresis). Differential diagnosis may be assisted by withdrawal and exposure experiments in certain cases. (63 references). © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - A review is presented of typical scanning electron microscopic aspects of urinary calculi. The mineralogic composition was determined by X ray diffraction, polarization microscopy and with the microprobe. The principal components of urinary calculi are oxalates, phosphates, urates, cystine, 'matrix', urostealith and bacteria. A mineralogic description is followed by a discussion of relationships between the morphology and genesis of the various types of concrements. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Conventional regimens of hydration and alkalization for the management of cystine and uric acid stones have fallen into disfavor because of the complications of hypertension, cardiovascular and renal failure, and potassium toxicity. The alternating use of acetazolamide with sodium bicarbonate provides a safe, reliable and constant alkalization of the urine while eliminating the hazard of sodium or fluid retention. It is the preferred long term therapy for cystinuria and the best treatment for dissolution of uric acid stones. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - A study was made of the influence of the diet on growth rate of calculi of the urinary tract in rabbits and their composition, using a foreign body urolithiasis model. A standardized normal nutrition was enriched with Ca carbonate, Ca phosphate, NH <inf>4</inf>Cl and MgO. The animals were divided into groups and sacrificed at various times. The weight and composition of the calculi were determined and by quantitative analysis changes in pH, Ca, P, Mg, K, Na, Cl and uric acid content of the urine and serum were analysed. The composition of the calculi is characteristically determined by the composition of the diet, as is the weight of the calculus. The composition of the urine was especially altered by large doses of Ca. On analysis of the serum no significant anomalies were seen.

AB  - Primary hyperoxaluria (P.H.) which comprizes 2 autosomal recessive inborn errors of metabolism, is characterized by increased endogenic synthesis of oxalic acid. In Type I primary hyperoxaluria ('glycolic aciduria') reduction of the activity of the enzyme alpha keto glutaric acid:glyoxylic acid carboligase is present. Increased excretion of oxalic acid and glycolic acid is found in the urine. In Type II primary hyperoxaluria ('L glyceric aciduria') the activity of the enzyme D glyceric acid dehydrogenase is absent. The excretion of oxalic acid in the urine is increased and, further, excretion of L glyceric acid is encountered. Following a review of P.H., a schematic review of the medicamental methods of treatment is presented together with an assessment of their effectiveness. A number of the treatment methods may be employed for treatment of calcium oxalate containing renal calculi in general. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Following an observation of extensive urolithiasis in rats fed a 10% casein diet with the mineral mixture of Hubbell, Mendel, and Wakeman, experiments were performed to determine the time course of stone formation. Weanling male rats of three strains developed urinary tract stones within 1 wk after being fed the experimental diet; the incidence and severity increased with time and death occurred in some animals from massive hematuria after 1 to 2 mths. Substituting a mineral supplement with a more physiological Ca:P ratio after 3 wk arrested the further development of urolithiasis. Earlier substituting, at 2 wk, resulted in disappearance of stones already formed. It is concluded that urolithiasis due to a high Ca:P ratio is reversible in its early phase. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Urine flow must be promoted and renal function must be ensured. Primary essential general measures are increase of diuresis, control of infection and diet. Drugs used in conditions with calcium oxalate stone (which are difficult to influence) are magnesium orthophosphate, allopurinol and vitamin B<inf>6</inf>. The formation of calcium phosphate stones or magnesium ammonium phosphate stones is prevented by ammonium chloride, ascorbic acid and aluminium hydroxide, cystine calculi may be treated with sodium potassium citrate, D penicillamine and α mercaptopropionylglycine. Uric acid stones, however, must be considered as a metabolic disturbance and the treatment should take the pathogenesis into consideration. Sodium potassium citrate and allopurinol are given. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Repeated urinary calculi developed in a patient who was treated with methazolamide for glaucoma. Previously, he had developed calculi while receiving acetazolamide. The factors involved in urinary calculus formation with carbonic anhydrase inhibitor therapy are reviewed. It appears that the incidence of calculus formation is less with methazolamide than with acetazolamide, and patients may be free of urinary symptoms when switched from acetazolamide to methazolamide therapy. It is suggested that the incidence of calculus formation in patients on any carbonic anhydrase inhibitor therapy may be reduced by increasing urine output, restricting calcium in diet, and by the use of aluminum hydroxide gel, oral sodium and potassium phosphates or hydrochlorothiazide. © 1973 Dr. W.

AB  - Lambs fattened on wheat diets were given supplements of sodium buffers and sodium chloride, and feed intake, body weight changes, and plasma mineral levels were measured. During the 84-day feeding period, daily feed intakes were 42 per cent higher and body weigh: increased by 36 per cent when wheat was supplemented with sodium bicarbonate, sodium bicarbonate and disodium hydrogen phosphate, or sodium chloride. When the diet was supplemented with disodium hydrogen phosphate body weight gains and feed intakes were lower than with the other supplements. This supplement also produced a high incidence of urinary calculi and this was not overcome by increasing the calcium level in the diet. The importance of these results in relation to grain feeding and buffer supplementation is discussed. © 1973 CSIRO. All Rights Reserved. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Local lavage to dissolve uric acid calculi was used in cases of ureteral obstruction. In two cases the lavage was carried out via a catheter introduced into the ureter by means of a cystoscope, and in one case, in which cne kidney had been nephrectomized, with the aid of a T-drain introduced via ureterostomy. At the same time the patients ingested Uralyt U to alkalize the urine. The dissolution of the stones took 1-3 weeks. The solution used for the local lavage was isotonic sodium bicarbonate, pH 7.0-8.5. © 1973 Informa UK Ltd All rights reserved: reproduction in whole or part not permitted. © 2014 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Coral like calculi are characterized by particular aspects deriving from their size and ramifications (rendering their extraction very difficult), their quiescent evolution in many instances, and their frequent recurrence and bilaterality. With reference to 140 cases of coral like calculi the authors discuss the treatment applied and results obtained in terms of the patients' age, bilaterality, course of the disease, complications, recurrence and general condition. Extraction was possible in 51 cases, with good results in 30 of them. In 21 cases nephrectomy was necessary and 68 patients were treated conservatively owing to local and general conditions. In general it is considered that the conservative treatment should be reserved for aged patients, with renal functional or general deficiencies. The new methods of extraction of coral like calculi have greatly improved the results of the conservative operation. Extraction is necessary in youths and in bilateral cases especially. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Healing of osteomalacia in response to treatment with sodium bicarbonate alone was compared in two women with renal tubular acidosis. One had normal glomerular function, the other had chronic renal failure as a result of nephrocalcinosis and renal calculi. The bone pain of the woman with normal glomerular function was quickly relieved, and osteomalacia healed completely within one year of correction of acidosis by regular treatment with sodium bicarbonate. Acidosis was not completely corrected in the uræmic woman: bone pain was relieved and pseudofractures healed, but her serum-alkaline-phosphatase remained high during treatment with alkali until she was treated with a large dose of calciferol (vitamin D<inf>2</inf>). It is suggested that osteomalacia in patients with renal tubular acidosis who are not uræmic should, in the first instance, be treated with alkali alone because of the dangers inherent in treatment with vitamin D. © 1972. © 2014 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The central nuclei of 500 urinary calculi in Japan, including 421 calculi of upper urinary tracts, 64 calculi of lower urinary tracts and 15 prostatic calculi, were analysed by infrared spectroscopy. The results of analysis revealed that 50.8% of calculi were composed of mixed calcium oxalate-calcium phosphate; 17.4%, simple calcium oxalate; 17.4%, magnesium ammonium phosphate mixed with calcium phosphate, and probably also with calcium carbonate; 4.4%, uric acid and urate with or without calcium phosphate or calcium oxalate; 3.2%, calcium phosphate; 1.0%, cystine; and 0.2% (one case) were composed of protein. Of 119 oxalate-phosphate calculi the ratios of calcium oxalate to calcium phosphate were measured on the chart of infrared spectra, and also the ratios of 53 cortices taken from these calculi were measured and compared to the ratios of these central nuclei. The results showed that the nuclei of oxalate-phosphate calculi contained greater amounts of calcium phosphate. © 1971 Springer-Verlag. © 2007 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Die Karbonat‐Harnsteine stellen einen häufigen “nichtentzündlichen” Konkrementtyp der Pflanzenfresser dar. Röntgendiffraktometrischen Untersuchungen zufolge bestehen diese Urolithen in der überwiegenden Mehrzahl der Fälle zu einem hohen Prozentsatz aus Calcit. Aragonit‐Steine sind selten und bleiben in ihrem Vorkommen auf große und kleine Wiederkäuer beschränkt. Vaterit wird als Nebenmineral in Calcit‐Nierensteinen der Equiden gefunden. Die detaillierte Auswertung der Röntgenbeugungsdiagramme von steinbildendem Calcit ergab einen stark wechselnden Anteil an Magnesiumkarbonat in fester Lösung Magnesium‐hakiger Calcit, wobei die höchsten Mg‐Konzentrationen in den Kalziumkarbonat‐Konkrementen von Rindern und kleinen Wiederkäuern nachgewiesen wurden. IR‐Spektrographische Untersuchungen ermöglichten ebenfalls eine Identifizierung der verschiedenen Karbonat‐Minerale und gaben Hinweise auf die räumliche Anordnung der CO<inf>3</inf>‐Gruppen im Kristallgitter des Karbonat‐Apatit. Mikroskopische bzw. polarisationsoptische Methoden gewährten Einblick in das innere Gefüge der Harnkonkremente bzw. gestatten bei geeigneter Präparation den Nachweis der einzelnen Komponenten auf Grund ihrer kristall‐optischen Merkmale; außerdem ergaben sich Hinweise auf die formale Genese der Konkremente. Zur Interpretation der Bildungsbedingungen von Karbonatkonkrementen wurde die Löslichkeit von Calcit im Harn — modellhaft als wäßrige Elektrolytlösung aufgefaßt — berechnet. Der Einfluß der Ionenstärke, der Harnreaktion und der organischen Polyelektrolyte des Harnes wurden diskutiert; dabei ergab sich, daß vor allem das Mg/Ca‐Verhältnis und der pH‐Wert des Harnes bei der Karbonat‐Urolithogenese kausalgenetisch wichtige Faktoren darstellen. Abschließend wurden die möglichen Ursachen das Kalziumkarbonat‐Polymorphismus in den Konkrementen pflanzenfressender Tiere erörtert. Carbonate urinary calculi in herbivorous domestic animals Carbonate calculi are a common type of non‐inflammatory stone in herbivores. X‐ray diffraction studies show that the great majority of these stones contain a high percentage of calcite. Aragonite stones are rare and are restricted to large and small ruminants. Vaterite was found as an accompanying mineral in calcite kidney stones in horses. Detailed study of X‐ray diffraction pictures of stone‐forming calcite showed a very varying content of magnesium carbonate (magnesium‐containing calcite); the highest magnesium concentration was found in calcium carbonate stones in cattle and small ruminants. Infra‐red spectrographic studies made it possible to identify the various carbonate minerals and gave evidence of the spacial arrangement of the CO<inf>3</inf> groups in the crystal lattice of the carbonate‐apatite. Microscopic studies, including polarisation optical methods, gave information about the inner structure of the stones and demonstrated their individual components on the basis of the optical properties of their crystals; these methods also gave some information about formation of the stones. To interpret the conditions of formation of carbonate stones the authors calculated the solubility of calcite in urine after the model of an aqueous solution of electrolytes. The influence of ionic strength, urinary pH and organic poly‐electrolytes in the urine is discussed. It was found that the Mg/Ca relationship and the pH of the urine are important factors in the formation of carbonate stones. Finally, the possible causes of calcium carbonate polymorphism in stones of herbivorous animals are discussed. Calculs urinaires carboniques des mammifères herbivores Les calculs urinaires carboniques forment un type de concrétion “non inflammatoire” chez les herbivores. Des examens de diffraction aux rayons X révèlent que ces urolithes sont composés dans la plupart des cas d'un fort pourcentage de calcite. Les calculs d'aragonite sont rares et leur apparition chez les grands et les petits ruminants reste limitée. Dans les calculs rénaux des équidés, on trouve, à côté de la calcite, de la whitérite comme sel minéral secondaire. L'interprétation des radiogrammes des calculs de calcite met en évidence une participation fortement variable de carbonate de magnésium (calcite à teneur de magnesium) et l'on trouve les concentrations en Mg les plus élevées dans les concrétions de carbonate de calcium des bovins et des petits ruminants. Des examens spectrographiques aux IR permettent également une indentification des différents carbonates et donnent des indications sur la configuration spatiale des groupements CO<inf>3</inf> dans le système cristallin carbonate‐apatite. Des méthodes microscopiques ou de polarisation optique ont permis d'examiner la structure interne des concrétions urinaires et, après préparation appropriée, de distinguer les différentes composantes grâce à leurs propriétés cristallooptiques; de plus, nous avons obtenu quelques indications sur la synthèse des concrétions. Pour pouvoir interpréter les conditions de formation des concrétions carboniques, nous avons calculé la solubilité de la calcite dans l'urine, d'après le modèle d'une solution aqueuse d'électrolytes. On discute l'influence de la force ionique, de la réaction urinaire et des poly‐électrolytes urinaires organiques: on trouve que le rapport Mg/Ca et la valeur du pH urinaire sont des facteurs génétiques causals importants dans la synthèse des urolithes carboniques. On aborde encore les causes possibles du polymorphisme du carbonate de calcium dans les concrétions des herbivores. Cálculos urinarios de carbonato en mamíferos herbívoros Los cálculos urinarios de carbonato son un tipo frecuente “no inflamatorio” de concremento en los herbívoros. Con arreglo a los estudios radio‐difractométricos, estos urolitos constan en la mayoría de los casos en un porcentaje muy elevado de calcita. Cálculos de aragonito son raros y quedan limitados en su presencia a los ruminates grandes y pequeños. Vaterita se halla como mineral secundario en los cálculos renales de calcita en los équidos. La interpretación detallada de los radiodifractodiagramas de calcita litiásica arrojó una parte variable en extremo de carbonato de magnesio en solución sólida (calcita que contiene magnesio), siendo apreciables las concentraciones máximas de Mg en los concrementos de carbonato calcico de bovinos y pequeños ruminates. Los estudios espectrográficos infrarrojos también posibilitaron la identificación de los distintos minerales de carbonato y ofrecieron indicaciones sobre la disposición espacial de los grupos CO<inf>3</inf> en la red cristalina del carbonato‐apatita. Los métodos microscópicos o bien polarópticos permitieron la percepción de la textura interior de los concrementos urinarios o bien permitían con preparación adecuada la identificación de los diversos componentes en atención a sus características cristalográficoópticas; además se infirieron indicios sobre la génesis formal de los concrementos. Para interpretar las condiciones de formatión de concrementos de carbonato, se calculó la solubilidad de calcita en orina interpretada en modelo como solución electrolítica acuosa. Se discutieron los influjos de la intensidad iónica, de la reacción de la orina y de los polielectrólitos orgánicos de la orina: en esto se infirió que ante todo la relación Mg/Ca y el valor pH de la orina representan factores causalgenéticos importantes en la carbonato‐urolitogenia. Por último, se comentan las causas posibles del polimorfismo del carbonato cálcico en los concrementos de los animales herbívoros. © 1971 Blackwell Verlag GmbH © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The composition of the crystalline material present in 5 renal calculi and pieces of prostatic calculi from patients suffering from alcaptonuria has been determined by the X‐ray powder method. The urinary stones contain standard calculus constituents. Some of the pieces of the prostatic calculi consist of a substituted calcite Ca(Mg, Mn)CO<inf>3</inf>, a substance not reported hitherto in a calculus. The stones, which are very dark in colour, also contain a small amount of the crystalline melanin‐type oxidation product of homogentisic acid and probably a larger amount of the pigment in a finely divided or amorphous state.

AB  - The composition of 88 male, 12 female and 12 juvenile stones (including the one from Emperor Napoleon III) from the Sir Henry Thompson collection of bladder calculi has been determined by X‐ray powder methods. An unusual substance identified is calcite. Uric acid is the major constituent of the adult stones and ammonium acid urate of the children's calculi. Comparison of the adult stones with a similar collection from the Norwich Hospital Museum shows that the Sir Henry Thompson collection contains less uric acid and more phosphates. © 1969 BJU International Company © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The effects of diet and other factors on the urinary excretion of oxalic acid were examined in normal subjects and patients with calcium oxalate-containing renal stones. Oxalate excretion varied directly with urine flow, suggesting that the renal tubular reabsorption of oxalate is determined by passive diffusion. The intestinal absorption and urinary excretion of oxalate were increased by reducing the dietary intake of calcium and by the oral ingestion of EDTA. Oxalate excretion was increased by the ingestion of glycine, glutamic acid and purines, reduced by ethinyl oestradiol and unaffected by ammonium chloride, sodium bicarbonate or magnesium. A diurnal variation in oxalate excretion was observed which was more evident in patients with renal calculi than in normal subjects. The diurnal rhythm was abolished by fasting. Longer-term variations in oxalate excretion were also observed. Oxalate excretion was usually reduced in hypoparathyroidism and increased in hyperparathyroidism and idiopathic hypercalciuria. It is concluded that the absorption of both oxalic acid and calcium may be increased in patients with idiopathic hypercalciuria. © 1969. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The paper discusses the causes of hypercalciuria and describes 15 cases of different origins all of which presented similarly with renal stones. The diagnosis of idiopathic hypercalciuria was made by exclusion. The effects of dietary restriction of calcium, sodium bicarbonate, cortisone, sodium phosphate, sodium phytate, and cellulose phosphate were demonstrated by calcium and phosphorus balance techniques. All were shown to have some urinary-calcium-lowering effect. Finally, a chlorothiazide derivative—namely, bendrofluazide—was also demonstrated to have a hypocalciuric effect, and the mode of action is discussed. © 1965, British Medical Journal Publishing Group.

AB  - A further study is reported of the medical treatment of cystinuria based mainly on a round-the-clock, high-fluid-intake routine. Of 18 patients on whom we have adequate data only 12 are at present keeping to the desired routine. Those who have failed to keep to the treatment have shown recurrent stone-formation or an increasing size of stones already present. Those who have kept to the treatment have shown no recurrence of stone when they began in a stone-free state. When they had stones to begin with, clear signs of stone-dissolution have appeared, results being sometimes spectacular. Dissolution was slower than theoretically expected, and we are obtaining evidence that cystine stones, as they grow, may from time to time lay down a coating of much less soluble material. The effect of treatment by alkalis, in addition to the fluid-drinking routine, is also reassessed. Doses of the order of 10 g. a day of sodium bicarbonate have very little effect. Very large doses, of the order of 30 g. a day, probably cause stone-dissolution to occur a little faster, but cannot yet be recommended for general use in view of possible long-term dangers. © 1965, British Medical Journal Publishing Group.

AB  - The principles underlying the aluminium hydroxide gel treatment of phosphatic calculi have been outlined. A new preparation called Hyalgel has been tried on a small series of urinary stone patients and its effect has been studied on the lowering of the urinary phosphate level, the size of renal calculi and the prevention of recurrent stones. Some difficulties in the application of this treatment have been discussed. Our preliminary results are given and compared with the more significant results of American writers.
